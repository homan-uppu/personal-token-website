### a personal token

A personal token represents an individual's equities in companies and other personal tokens. A personal token can be divided into shares and sold to investors.

<PersonalTokenComp />

The value of a personal token is <u>grounded in reality</u>: its owner's
equities in companies and other personal tokens (which are grounded in equities
in companies).

Capital gains cut + secondary sales. (Show that liquidation opportunities exist, and that you don't have to wait decades to get returns).

### invest in a person as a whole

By investing in a person's personal token, you're not betting on a single idea, but rather on their judgement <u>across the range of their expressions</u>: the companies they will work at, start, invest in, and also other personal tokens they will invest in.

<Accordion title="Why raise through personal tokens instead of through a company?">

Personal tokens allow you to raise capital earlier: even before you've determined a specific direction or are ready to start a company.

By raising capital through your personal token you have more freedom in how you create value. Unlike company fundraising that locks you into a specific business, personal tokens give you flexibility to explore multiple paths. You can start companies, join promising ones as an employee, invest in companies / other personal tokens, or combine these approaches. Your investors benefit when you succeed in any of these paths, as your equity holdings in companies and other personal tokens increase in value.

<Accordion title="Why invest in personal tokens?">

Investing in a brilliant individual's personal token is a safer bet than investing in a specific idea they have. Even brilliant founders often fail with their first ventures. But, on a long enough time horizon, talent wins.

You can back promising talent earlier: before they've even decided which problem to solve or company to build. This early access can lead to greater returns as you identify and support exceptional individuals at the beginning of their trajectory.

Personal tokens open investment opportunities that simply didn't exist before. You can now invest directly in brilliant people who choose to join companies rather than found themâ€”the exceptional engineers, designers, and operators who create tremendous value but previously offered no way for outside investors to participate in their success. Personal tokens democratize access to the full spectrum of talent, not just those who choose the entrepreneurial path.

<Accordion title="How would a personal token be valued?">
As with investing in early stage startups, personal token valuations for the first fundraise will likely default to an soft standard (a standard that is recommended, but not enforced). I predict that will be somewhere between $50k - $500k for 1% of equity.

This default valuation is greater than the default US startup valuation (i.e. $500k for 3 - 7% equity in the US) because a personal token captures value from _all_ of the companies its owner gains equity at in the future, as opposed to a single company - hence the standard valuation for a personal token should be higher than it is for a startup.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the personal token holder never starts a company?">
  Personal tokens incentivize VCs / mentors to help individuals who may never
  want to start a company, but instead join great ones - because they can still
  capture the value those individuals create (through personal tokens) even
  though they can't invest in their companies (because they won't start any).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when a personal token owner dies?">

When a personal token holder dies, the Network initiates a succession protocol to ensure an orderly transition that protects all shareholders. After death verification, the personal token enters a settlement phase.

For assets within the Network (investments in other personal tokens), the liquidation process is handled automatically according to our established protocols. For external assets like company equity, the Network works with the deceased's estate and follows standard legal processes that govern such assets (wills, trusts, estate law), as these cannot be directly liquidated within our system.

The Network coordinates with the executor of the estate to ensure that the value of external assets is appropriately accounted for and distributed. All proceeds from both internal and external assets are distributed to shareholders proportionally based on their ownership stakes.

This approach respects both the personal token holder's established succession planning and the rights of their investors, while acknowledging the inherent "key person risk" that comes with personal token investments. After settlement is complete, the personal token is permanently frozen in the Network.
