### a personal token

A personal token represents an individual's equities in companies and other personal tokens. A personal token can be divided into shares and sold to investors.

The value of a personal token **is grounded in reality**: its owner's
equities in companies and other personal tokens (which are grounded in equities
in companies).

When you invest in someone's personal token, you earn [dividends](/docs#dividends): a portion of the token holder's capital gains proportional to the equity you hold. You can also sell equity to others through [secondary sales](/docs#secondary-sales).

### invest in a person as a whole

By investing in a person's personal token, you're not betting on a single idea, but rather on their judgement **across the range of their expressions**: the companies they will work at, start, invest in, and also other personal tokens they will invest in.
