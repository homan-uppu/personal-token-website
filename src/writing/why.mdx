As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will require greater creativity than ever before because AI will do the less creative work for us.

This shift toward creative work is progress. We are fundamentally creative beings, and AI is finally freeing us from the repetitive labor that has dominated human history, ushering in an age of creativity.

But creative work follows an unforgiving power law distribution: a tiny fraction of participants generate most of the economic value. The more creative the task, the more extreme the power law distribution: even more value is created by fewer best, and the lower the median outcome becomes - the average will struggle to create enough value.

This power law isn't a temporary phenomenon — it's an inseparable feature of creative endeavors. We already see it in filmmaking, content creation, entrepreneurship, and sports. As AI transforms all work into creative work, this winner-take-most dynamic will spread to everything we do.

Our economic system — built around predictable returns — wasn't designed for creative work's extreme outcomes. Education loans will become unsustainable as most graduates won't earn enough to repay them, just as most film school graduates never become profitable directors. We're seeing early signs of this: the job market is terrible for junior talent, while better than ever before for those who are great at what they do.

Our loan & credit based economic system is on the verge of collapse. The worst hit will be those who don't already have wealth. Though AI will enable us to tackle our greatest challenges, on top of our outdated economic system, AI will likely amplify the opportunity gap between those who have wealth and the rest.

Unequal access to opportunity hurts all of us.

In this age of creativity, venture capital — not debt — is the best way to finance learning. By raising capital in exchange for equity in their future outcomes, individuals can pursue ambitious learning paths and opportunities without the crushing debt that most will struggle to repay due to the power law.

Yet, today's venture capital only flows to founders who are ready to start companies. What about individuals who have more to learn before they can (or want) to start a company? Or those who create immense value as employees rather than as founders?

The personal token is a new financial instrument that expands the reach of venture capital by enabling individuals to sell equity in the wealth they will create in the future (through their ownerships of companies and other personal tokens).

In this creative age, personal tokens (or whatever they will be called) is an essential infrastructure for democratizing opportunity, enabling those with potential regardless of the wealth they come from.
