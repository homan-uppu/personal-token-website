As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will require greater creativity than ever before since AI will do the less creative work for us.

This shift toward creative work isn't just change, it's progress. We are fundamentally creative beings, and AI is finally freeing us from the repetitive labor that has dominated human history, ushering in an age of creativity

But creative work follows an unforgiving power law distribution: a tiny fraction of participants generate most of the economic value. The more creative the task, the more participants, the better the education for all, the more extreme the power law distribution: even more value created by fewer best, and a lower the median outcome - the average will struggle to create enough value.

This power law isn't a temporary "bug"—it's an inseparable feature of creative endeavors. We already see it in filmmaking, content creation, entrepreneurship, and sports. As AI transforms all work into creative work, this winner-take-most dynamic will spread to all activities.

Our economic system—built around predictable returns—wasn't designed for creative work's extreme outcomes. Education loans become unsustainable when most graduates can't earn enough to repay them, just as most film school graduates never become profitable directors.

Our loan & credit based economic system is on the verge of collapse. The worst hit will be those who don't already have wealth. Though AI will enable us to tackle our greatest challenges, on top of our outdated economic system, AI will likely amplify the opportunity gap between those who have wealth and the rest.

Unequal access to opportunity hurts all of us.

In the age of creativity, venture capital—not debt—is the best way to finance learning. By raising capital in exchange for equity in their future earnings, individuals can pursue ambitious learning paths and opportunities without the crushing debt that most will struggle to repay due to the power law.

Yet, today's venture capital only flows to founders who are ready to start companies. What about individuals with potential who aren't yet ready to start a company? Or those who create immense value within organizations rather than founding them?

The personal token is a new financial instrument that expands the reach of venture capital by enabling individuals to sell equity in the wealth they will create in the future (through their ownerships of companies and other personal tokens).

For investors, personal tokens open new frontiers: investing earlier in someone's journey (before they start a company), and in exceptional individuals who create value as employees rather than founders.

In this emerging creative age, personal tokens will become essential infrastructure for democratizing opportunity, allowing talent—not existing wealth—to determine who succeeds.
