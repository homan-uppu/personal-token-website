### Democratize opportunity

My aim is to democratize opportunity.

Personal tokens give people financial reasons to help create a world where each individual has what they need to discover and achieve their full potential.

While there is still significant inequality of opportunity in the world today, there has not been a better period in human history for someone with little. Most can access troves of knowledge through their smartphones, internet, and now through AI. Innovations in technology promise us a world in which everyone has access to powerful tools to learn and to turn their ideas into reality.

Yet, democratizing access to tools alone doesn't sufficiently democratize opportunity. Individuals require capital _(and often guidance & community)_  to have the space to explore & tinker - so that they can discover their innate potentials and to then realize them.

Most people intuitively understand that putting resources in the hands of young people to finance their learning & exploration will lead to greater long-term prosperity for all. But, we consistently fail to transfer sufficient capital to the hands of young people. Why is that?

Those who hold power to allocate such capital: the rich (who can give money from their pockets), and the old (who determine political outcomes in much of the developed world), have no incentive to transfer wealth to the young to fuel their growth.

Grants, scholarships, public policies to transfer capital to the hands of young people rely on goodwill - on the benevolence of individuals (the old and/or rich) - who don't directly benefit from such a transfer of capital aside from the status that comes from being seen as "doing good". 

It's incredibly foolish to rely on such goodwill to democratize opportunity because goodwill doesn't scale.

Goodwill manifests as a weak, fleeting, inconsistent emotion. We don't have to look far to see why: how often do each of us actually act out of a feeling of goodwill for collective happiness and prosperity? Even when we do feel such goodwill, it's usually fleeting. <Annotation>And often what we think is goodwill is actually something far more selfish (craving for status, recognition, etc.).</Annotation>

Personal tokens create a direct relationship between the future prosperity of the investor and who they're investing in. Future rewards from investing in young people with potential are made clear: invest $x today in someone and if they create great value for the world, you directly profit significantly. These profits aren't blurry: they won't be filtered through a massive centralized government structure that seems to eat up much of the resources it promises to give back to its citizens... the gains come straight into the wallet of investors.

On the other hand, personal tokens let investors directly profit from supporting promising young people. The system is simple and clear: invest money in someone today, and if they succeed in creating value for the world, you make money. This creates a practical reason to invest in talented young people - investors are motivated by potential returns, not just by wanting to help others.

There is no force more powerful than greed. Greed is anti-fragile: we are greedy in bad times and even more greedy during good times. Greed is consistent: you can always bet on greed. And importantly, greed scales: for every person donating to a scholarship program out of goodwill, or for every older person voting to make higher education free out of goodwill, there will be thousands more who would invest (and invest a lot) in an individual out of the desire for profits.

Personal tokens will push far more capital into the hands of young people with the potential to do great work.

### Growth

Even with the right incentives in place, we can't expect equal opportunity to appear overnight. While we might succeed in giving resources to everyone who can create value today, we still face a bigger challenge: many children start life with unequal opportunities. How can we close this gap?

I see opportunity being democratized in two phases:
1. **Efficiency**: capital is allocated to overlooked talent who already exist in the world.
2. **Expansion**: capital is allocated towards high quality learning environments for all children to increase overall number of investable individuals (i.e. increase the overall market).

Phase 2 starts once the talent market is sufficiently efficient and prosperous. The investors who generate strong returns will become more ambitious, and will allocate more capital towards increasing the number of talented individuals they can invest in by investing in systems that benefit children.

Therefore, we can accelerate democratization of opportunity by optimizing for economic growth: maximizing the number of personal tokens in the Network, and their valuations. Growth will lead to a sufficient efficiency that will push investors to expand the future market, to further democratize opportunity. <Annotation>ofc, there's a limit to how far we can push equal opportunity. underlying genetic differences that make each of us unique give some individuals natural, "unfair" advantages over others. we will get a glimpse of what those innate advantages are only when all other advantages are sufficiently democratized.</Annotation>

### Trust

So, how do we optimize for economic growth? By cultivating trust.

Users in the Network must trust that:
1. their ownership of other personal tokens will be honored forever - that they won't wake up one day to find that the system has collapsed taking their wealth with it.
2. the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make decisions is accurate and true (aligned with reality).

To understand why trust in information is so important, we need to see how lies have the potential to kill the Network.

In the Network, misrepresentation of reality (lies) can be in the following ways:
1. Saying you are who you're not.
2. Saying you've accomplished things that you actually haven't.
3. Saying you want to do something with the capital you will raise without actually having the intention to do it.
4. Omitting some (or all) of your ownership of companies outside of the Network.

Each form of misrepresentation has a likely cause. Those who don't identify themselves accurately are likely trying shed the burden of their poor track record, or history of actions that hurt their chances to raise capital. Those who bloat what they've accomplished, or tell ambitious stories of how they'll use capital raised without intending to spend it that way are trying to cheat investors out of money. Those who omit their ownership of companies outside of the Network are likely trying to skip paying the appropriate share of capital gains to their personal token shareholders when they sell equity in companies outside of the Network.

Investors burned by fraud wouldn't want to invest again. Fraud spooks potential investors from ever participating. Fraud will kill the Network.

**A Network of personal tokens that simply facilitates transactions (buying and selling equity in personal tokens) won't work without the necessary auxiliary functions that minimize fraud and cultivate trust.**
### Sufficient decentralization

By decentralization, I mean decentralization of power: distributing power to many, as opposed to concentrating power in the hands of few. <Annotation>Unfortunately because of the hype surrounding crypto, many assume decentralization to just mean slapping everything onto a blockchain. Decentralization is a civilizational theme that is much broader than any specific piece of technology, and has been a growing trend for centuries.</Annotation>

Naturally, there's a notion of "degree": the more decentralized a network of people is, the more individuals the power is distributed to, and the more evenly it's distributed.

Examples of decentralization of varying degrees:

- Dictatorship < representative democracy < individual democracy (every decision voted on by everyone).
- Social platform with one feed algorithm < Social platform with a marketplace of third party feed algorithms < social platform in which each user can create their own algorithm by training their own AI model.
- One centralized bank that controls all transactions < multiple competing banks < peer to peer transactions without an intermediary.

Before we explore the pros and cons of decentralization and why it makes sense to build the Network in a decentralized way, it would help to understand what decentralization looks like in the context of the Network of personal tokens so that we can ground our discussion in the practical impact on our Network, rather than have it be a philosophical discussion.

#### Decentralization in the context of the Network:

**1. Decentralized representation of personal tokens**: at the core of the Network is information about personal tokens: who owns how much of which token. Transacting equity in personal tokens is essentially just manipulating this ledger. By making this ledger decentralized, there is no centralized source of truth that can be easily manipulated by a third party.

**2. Decentralized admissions**: instead of a centralized authority determining who can get into the Network and benefit from it, that power is decentralized in the hands of the many investors: if you can successfully raise capital by selling equity in your personal token, you are officially an active participant in the Network. There isn't a singular notion / criteria for what makes someone investable, but rather many competing notions.

**3. Decentralized reputation system**. As discussed earlier, a reputation system must:
1. Uncover gaps between claims & reality.
2. Rubric to determine the degree of severity of a fraudulent action.
3. Consistently interpret & apply that rubric for specific cases.

A decentralized reputation system would have a distributed means to uncover lies (e.g. like a community notes system), multiple rubrics to select from, and multiple ways to interpret rubrics. Users can propose their own reputation systems and publish on an open market. As soon as a user "activates" a reputation system, it scores everyone in the Network according to its specific design. The reputation system that most people select over time will become the most popular and "de-facto" reputation system. And if users decide another one is better, they can switch to it.

**4. Decentralized discovery**: instead of a single algorithm (/ model) to match investors and individuals to invest in, anyone can create and publish their own algorithm that others can use.

#### Why decentralize?

A decentralized network is easier for users to trust, and enables the network to better evolve to match the growing needs of its users in ways that the builders of the network can't even imagine. I predict that with sufficient time, no system: whether nation, social platform, financial system, etc. will last unless it becomes sufficiently decentralized: distributing power among its users, and protecting that distribution through technology, without requiring users to have to rely on a fallible authority to preserve their influence.

Therefore, in order for the Network to stand the test of time and last for centuries, it must be designed to be sufficiently decentralized at its core, and evolve to be more decentralized over time. As discussed earlier, opportunity will not be democratized overnight. It will take time. The Network must last.

A decentralized representation of ownership in personal tokens builds trust: it's not easy for someone (say an individual, or company, or even government) to manipulate your ownership in personal tokens without your permission.

Decentralization encourages people to build on top of the Network because they don't feel like they're building on someone else's land that can be snatched away from them anytime.

For example, an application built on the Network could allow users to form "collectives" which invest in personal tokens together. Future educational institutions, and mentorship programs could be created as collectives on the network with the teachers, and perhaps even alumni, investing together in every new student they accept.

Similarly, there are many potential, useful, applications that can be built on a decentralized personal token network that we can't even imagine right now - in the same way that the early creators of the internet couldn't imagine the rich possibilities that could be created on top of the internet (social platforms, tools, knowledge bases, remote collaboration, etc.) Therefore, building a network in a decentralized way is also a form of healthy humility: accepting that our imaginations are limited and that we need the help of users and third party creators to build on top of the network in order for the network to best serve its users.

#### Optimal decentralization

Decentralization has a cost:

1. Less efficient in the early days. A centralized authority can make decisions more swiftly.
2. Can be less secure: when a transaction is irreversible by a centralized authority, individuals must be more careful because you can't simply reverse the transaction / easily recover stolen assets like how you can do with the [chargeback system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp) with traditional financial transactions.
3. Takes more time to design, build, and iterate on such that it's simple to use, secure, while still being sufficiently decentralized.

What is the optimal amount of decentralization, and which factors determine optimality?

Decentralize too quickly and you end up with a system that makes it more difficult to get traction and grow. Decentralize too slow and you will be outcompeted by a more decentralized network. It's a balancing act.

I propose that in the early days of the Network, the ledger that keeps track of ownerships in personal tokens is decentralized (maintained on a blockchain), while the reputation system that tackles fraud be centralized in the hands of the core team. Building a decentralized reputation system requires a sufficient number of users and transactions on the Network which we will not have in the beginning.

This will allow us to ship the Network quickly, gain initial traction and then start to decentralize the Network more as the Network becomes more mature.

## IV. Functions

### 1. Reputation

The best way to dis-incentivize fraud is to:
1. Ensure users of the Network have high ambition. Ambitious individuals operate on longer time horizons and care more about their reputation. In a high trust network, people care about their reputations.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors. To do this, we'll need some kind of reputation system.

A good reputation system:
- would have a sufficiently granular "score" so that different kinds of fraud would impact reputation according to how badly they impact the Network.
- quickly uncover gaps between what a user claims is true and reality.
- would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network.
- would interpret the rubric accurately & consistently for each case.
- would make a user's reputation available publicly to let users to make more informed decisions about who they choose to invest in, or accept as investors.
- would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.
- would be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the impact of the biases of a single authority (which are bound to exist).

### 2. Synchronization

When personal token owners sell their equity in other personal tokens or companies, they share the capital gained with their own token shareholders (proportional to how much equity each shareholder holds).

When capital is gained by selling equity in a personal token, the Network can automatically distribute the capital gained to shareholders because the source of truth for personal tokens is within the Network. But, when a personal token owner sells equity in a company, how will that capital gained be distributed to shareholders?

<SyncScene />

In the early days of the Network, users will have to self-report capital gains from selling equity in companies.

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/), etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

In the long-run, the Network should aim to be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies as well in order to eliminate relying on self-reporting by individuals.

### 3. Discovery

Over time the Network should facilitate match-making between investors and individuals they'd want to invest in.

### 4. Culture

Adding culture as a necessary function to support the Network feels weird because it seems more like an emergent property of the Network rather than something we can directly control. Yet, the culture of a network is perhaps its most important feature: a culture influences what its members want, and what its members want determines how a network will evolve.

By culture I mean a shared set of beliefs, values and priorities. In order to democratize opportunity, we need to maximize growth. To maximize growth, we need a culture of ambition. Ambition simultaneously maximizes growth (as members aim bigger) and minimizes fraud because ambitious individuals wouldn't want to tarnish their reputation for a puny reward compared to what they would achieve by fulfilling their ambitions.

It's tempting to promote ambition in a hard-handed way - e.g. by only admitting individuals into the Network who we consider to be ambitious enough, by setting a minimum investment amount, etc. - because it is impossible to set a criteria to accurately identify ambition. The most ambitious individuals are precisely the ones who operate beyond any rigid, predetermined criteria. Therefore, the Network needs to give space to the market to identify ambition, without imposing any specific notion of ambition as a filter - which will certainly be too rigid and inaccurate).

The Network will have to be open to all, regardless of the domains they operate in, whether they are artists, technologists, entrepreneurs, or creators of any kind.

We can only cultivate ambition in an off-handed, indirect way: by celebrating achievements by personal token holders, and to make such successes visible to all on the Network - to inspire everyone to think bigger and aim higher.

The right incentives (which we have through personal tokens), and sufficient visibility of success on the Network should be enough to encourage more ambition over time.
