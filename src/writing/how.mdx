### The Network

This system works as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I'll refer to this system as the “Network”.

Both the individual raising capital, and the investor investing in others will need their own personal token in the Network to be able to transact with each other.

### A personal token

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token (as number of shares out of total shares available).
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network - i.e. in the "real world") that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. A user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. For example, if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice's personal token.

When I use to the word "user" I'm referring to the person behind the personal token who is acting in the Network through their personal token.

Personal tokens are fundamentally different from companies. While company shareholders can vote on company decisions, personal token holders don't have voting rights over the person they invest in. When you own someone's personal token, you don't 'own' any part of that actual person, you only get a share of the wealth they create.

A personal token's value comes from how much wealth people think its owner will make in the future. For example: Amy sells shares of her personal token to investors. When Amy does well and shows she can be successful, people believe she'll create more wealth in the future, so her token becomes more valuable. But if Amy keeps struggling and doesn't show promise, her token loses value.

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising rounds. Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime is important because it gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

Users can raise money by selling shares of their personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds". Having set fundraising rounds, instead of letting anyone buy or sell at any time, gives users greater control over who owns shares of their personal token.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors.

The owner of a personal token has the final say about who can be a shareholder of their personal token. When a fundraising round is completed, the Network applies the transaction: money is transferred, and ownership information is updated.

### Invest

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or have someone they know apply to invest. All transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network. <Annotation>a token holder is incentivized to not be a menace by unfairly rejecting all sales because that would likely spook existing and future investors, and tarnish their reputation</Annotation>

### Capital distribution

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

When someone sells their equity - whether it's in another personal token or in a company outside the Network - the capital gained from that sale are shared among all shareholders of their personal token. Each shareholder receives capital proportional to the equity they hold.
