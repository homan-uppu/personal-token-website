## I. Intro

A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's economic potential.

Similar to how companies issue shares to raise capital, individuals can raise capital by selling shares in their person token to investors. When the personal token owner makes money from selling their investments in companies or other personal tokens, shareholders in their personal token get their share of the profits. In other words, a personal token's value is grounded in its owner's stakes in companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially the kind of talent that is underrated and overlooked. **Therefore, personal tokens incentivize democratizing opportunity.**

In this paper I've attempted to show how I see personal tokens working, and how to implement them. This is an early draft. I'd appreciate your feedback.

## II. How it works

### The Network

This system works as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I’ll refer to this system as the “Network”.

Both the individual raising capital, and the investor investing in others will need their own personal token in the Network to be able to transact with each other.

### A personal token

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token (as number of shares out of total shares available).
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network - i.e. in the "real world") that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

<Card caption="A personal token with shareholders and a portfolio of other personal tokens and companies.">
  <PersonalTokenComp />
</Card>

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. A user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. For example, if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice’s personal token.

When I use to the word "user" I'm referring to the person behind the personal token who is acting in the Network through their personal token.

Personal tokens are fundamentally different from companies. While company shareholders can vote on company decisions, personal token holders don't have voting rights over the person they invest in. When you own someone's personal token, you don't 'own' any part of that actual person, you only get a share of the wealth they create.

A personal token's value comes from how much wealth people think its owner will make in the future. For example: Amy sells shares of her personal token to investors. When Amy does well and shows she can be successful, people believe she'll create more wealth in the future, so her token becomes more valuable. But if Amy keeps struggling and doesn't show promise, her token loses value.

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising rounds. Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime is important because it gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

Users can raise money by selling shares of their personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds". Having set fundraising rounds, instead of letting anyone buy or sell at any time, gives users greater control over who owns shares of their personal token.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors.

The owner of a personal token has the final say about who can be a shareholder of their personal token. When a fundraising round is completed, the Network applies the transaction: money is transferred, and ownership information is updated.

### Invest

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or have someone they know apply to invest. All transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.  <Annotation>a token holder is incentivized to not be a menace by unfairly rejecting all sales because that would likely spook existing and future investors, and tarnish their reputation</Annotation>

### Capital distribution

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

When someone sells their equity - whether it's in another personal token or in a company outside the Network - the capital gained from that sale are shared among all shareholders of their personal token. Each shareholder receives capital proportional to the equity they hold.

<CapitalGainsAnimation />

Capital gains from selling equity (whether in companies or in personal tokens) flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network.

For example, if Alice holds Bob's personal token, and Bob holds Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (which includes Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (which includes Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value.

### Notes

- [Pro rata rights](https://www.angellist.com/learn/pro-rata-rights).
- Min / max investment amount - to give fundraising user control over how many investors will participate in round.
- Minimum percentage of equity a user needs in their own personal token.
- Capped returns? For example, if an investor makes 1000x returns from a personal token, should their equity in that personal token be returned to its owner?

### Examples

Bob, a high school student, runs a podcast in which he interviews interesting scientists. He's good at choosing guests and asking engaging questions, which has helped him build a small but dedicated audience. Ryan, who hosts a popular podcast, sees Bob's talent and offers him a deal: $50,000 in exchange for 1% of Bob's personal token. Ryan is financially incentivized to help Bob succeed. With this money, Bob can focus completely on improving his podcast instead of having to work a part-time job - accelerating his learning.

Amy, an undergraduate student studying nuclear power, published a paper that didn't get much attention at a major conference. However, Maya, who runs a nuclear energy startup, saw potential in Amy's work. Maya decided to invest in Amy's personal token, which allows Amy to continue her research freely without worrying about getting grants (which was difficult because Amy's research direction was unpopular).

Maya feels confident about this investment because she believes that though Amy's research is unpopular today, it will be the standard in the future, making Amy incredibly valuable to the world. With the capital raised, Amy can now pursue her research intuitions without being held back by the status quo.

## III. Implementation

### Trust

The Network ought to be implemented in a way that maximizes users' trust in the Network. Cultivating trust is the highest priority, because without trust, users won't invest, and without investments there is no Network. <Annotation>trust is especially important in the early days because investing in personal tokens is a new behavior for the world: many will be skeptical</Annotation>

A trustable Network is:
1. **Reliable**. The Network does as it says. It consistently, correctly updates its state on each transaction (buying / selling equity in personal tokens).
2. **Predictable**. Users should have confidence that the Network will continue to operate the way it does for the foreseeable future, based on the incentives that govern all of its members who act out of their self-interest, rather than based on the whims of a single user / authority.
3. **Honest**. Facts provided by the system are true (aligned with reality). Users can rely on information about who a user says they are, what they say they've accomplished, their previous fundraising rounds, etc.

In order to be trustable, the Network must be sufficiently decentralized.

### Sufficiently decentralized

Decentralization - _distributing power to many, as opposed to concentrating it in the hands of few_ - creates trust. <Annotation>unfortunately, due of the hype surrounding crypto, many assume decentralization to just mean slapping everything onto a blockchain. decentralization is a civilizational theme that is much broader than any specific piece of technology, and has been a growing trend for centuries</Annotation>

Examples of decentralization (lesser to greater):

- Dictatorship < representative democracy < individual democracy (every decision voted on by everyone).
- Social platform with one feed algorithm < Social platform with a marketplace of third party feed algorithms < social platform in which each user can create their own content algorithm by training their own AI model.
- One bank that controls all transactions < multiple competing banks < peer to peer transactions without an intermediary.

In the context of the Network, decentralization can manifest in many ways.

Let's start with its core: I propose implementing the personal token ledger (that keeps track of who owns how much of which personal tokens) on [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/), using a stablecoin ([USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc)) as the currency that fuels transactions in the Network.

By decentralizing the ledger itself, and processing transactions through [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), the Network is more reliable and predictable. An authority, including the builders of the Network, can't easily manipulate personal token ownership, and the exchange of capital for shares in a personal token happens programmatically, eliminating the opportunity for delays and other messy situations. <Annotation>such as an investor receiving shares, and then realizing they can't pay for them</Annotation>

Another benefit of decentralizing the personal token ledger is that it enables the Network to evolve more rapidly to match the growing needs of its users in ways that the builders of the Network can't even imagine. Third party tools and applications can't be censored or blocked by an authority, encouraging users to build tools and experiences for themselves without the fear that what they build will be blocked in the future due to the [whims of a centralized authority](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price).

For example, a third party application built on the Network could allow users to form "collectives" which allows them to invest in personal tokens together. Future educational institutions, and mentorship programs could be created as collectives on the network with the teachers, and perhaps even alumni, investing together in every new student they accept. Another powerful application built on the Network would be discovery: connect individuals looking to raise capital, and investors, perhaps with a social feed angle.

Similarly, there are many potential, useful, applications that can be built on a decentralized personal token network that we can't even imagine right now - in the same way that the early creators of the internet couldn't imagine the rich possibilities that could be created on top of it (social platforms, tools, knowledge bases, remote collaboration, etc.) Decentralizing the foundation of the Network is also an expression of humility: we are accepting that our imaginations are limited and that we need the help of many creators to build experiences on top of personal tokens to meet the growing / changing needs of the users of the Network.

The personal token ledger is one of many functions the Network provides. Each function of the Network has the potential to be more decentralized. For example, a decentralized reputation system that identifies when a user is lying about their accomplishments through a [community notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) type design would be far better than a central authority responsible for figuring out if a user is being dishonest.

Yet, decentralization has a cost:

1. Less efficient in the early days (before it achieves a critical mass of users and transactions). A centralized authority can make decisions more swiftly.
2. Can be less secure: when a transaction is irreversible by a centralized authority, it's far more tricky to recover stolen assets like how you can do with the [chargeback system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp) in traditional, centralized, financial systems.
3. Takes more time to design, build, and iterate on.

Decentralize too quickly and you end up with a system that makes it more difficult to get traction and grow. Decentralize too slow and you will be outcompeted by a more decentralized network that is easier to trust and more swiftly adapts to users' needs by better encouraging an ecosystem of third party applications.

At launch, I believe the right balance of decentralization is as follows: except for the core ledger, all other functions will be centralized: handled by the team responsible for building and maintaining the Network. As the Network gains momentum: adds users, increases transactions, all functions will become more decentralized. As I describe the remaining functions of the Network in the rest of this chapter, I'll describe what I think they should look like at launch, as well as a high level overview of how I see the function becoming more decentralized over time.

### Reputation

Users in the Network must trust that the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make investment decisions is truthful.

Fraudulent users will want to lie in order to raise capital by saying they are someone they're not or by exaggerating / outright lying about their past accomplishments.

The best way to minimize fraud is to:

1. Ensure users of the Network are highly ambitious. Ambitious individuals operate on longer time horizons and care more about their reputation. In a high trust network, people care about their reputations.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors. To do this, we'll need some kind of reputation system.

#### At launch:

The core team will have the authority to ban users who try to lie / manipulate for profit. Users can complain to the core team about anything they're suspicious about, and the team will evaluate and take action.

In the early days, even a small suspicion will be enough to ban users because we won't have the resources to deal with each situation in a nuanced way. It's better to be safe than sorry.

That being said, each decision to ban a user will be transparent: it will be recorded on the personal token itself (on the decentralized personal token ledger) with an explanation (ideally with evidence) for why the user was banned.

#### Future implementation:

- would have a sufficiently granular "score" so that different kinds of fraud would impact reputation according to how badly they impact the Network.
- quickly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality through a [community notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Notes) design, but also with a way to financially reward contributors based on their performance.
- would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network.
- would interpret the rubric accurately & consistently for each case.
- would make a user's reputation available publicly to let users to make more informed decisions about who they choose to invest in, or accept as investors.
- would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.
- would allow for multiple competing reputation systems. users can adopt the one that they they are most aligned with, or even create their own. To get to this point, AI will likely need to become more powerful (and cheaper) so that a user can write their own rubric, and the AI will score all other users of the Network with this rubric applied on ground truth determined by the community notes style function.

### Admission

Having highly ambitious users is critical for the success of the Network.

Ambitious ideas usually require sustained effort over long periods of time, and are usually highly collaborative in nature (not just in terms of building out the idea, but also in terms of needing to raise capital from the world, and getting buy-in from society at large).

**Ambitious individuals are forced to have high integrity** (proportional to how ambitious they are) because if they want to succeed they have to have a strong reputation in order to attract great teammates, raise capital, and importantly sustain both for long periods of time. An ambitious individual known for cheating their investors or teammates won't be able to succeed.

A Network of highly ambitious individuals with a strong reputation system as described above, will naturally have little fraud, and will grow quickly.

Therefore, it's tempting to restrict the Network only to ambitious individuals, but this would be a massive blunder because it is impossible to have a singular, accurate definition of what ambition looks like. Highly ambitious ideas (and thereby highly ambitious individuals) fall outside of definitions. In fact, it's that nature of being too weird to grasp that makes them so ambitious in the first place.

A network that has an "admission criteria" will become stale very quickly. It might work in the early days, but over time **any admission criteria will deteriorate towards rejecting the most ambitious individuals.** <Annotation>for example: United States, Harvard, YCombinator, all suffer from this</Annotation>

The best way to approximate the definition of "highly ambitious" is to leave it to a free market of investors who each vote with their capital on the people who they think are highly ambitious. The Network's job is to rely on the signal provided by investors by giving certain privileges (such as being able to vote on feature / policy decisions, etc.) to only those that have raised capital.

That being said, in the very early days, before the Network has a sufficient number of investors, it makes sense to have an admission criteria to try and admit only highly ambitious individuals, because there won't enough investors (i.e. enough votes) to accurately approximate the definition of "highly ambitious". As soon as we hit a sufficient number of investors, we will swiftly remove any admission criteria.

With this in mind, I propose the following implementation:

#### At launch:

The core team will vet the initial set of investors who can come on board to invest in personal tokens. Early investors will have an outsized impact on the culture of the Network, so it's important to get the right people on board: individuals who are also invested in the system of investing through personal tokens, in addition to wanting to invest in individuals, and are patient, long-term, ambitious investors, with an track-record of investing in big ideas.

These investors will be able to invite into the Network the individuals who's personal tokens they want to invest in.

#### Future implementation:

Anyone can join the Network to create their personal token, raise capital, and invest in other personal tokens. But, only users who have been invested in, or have invested in others (above a minimum amount) will be treated as "active" users of the Network who will have certain privileges that others won't such as being able to vote on feature / policy decisions, etc.

### Synchronization

When personal token owners sell their equity in other personal tokens or companies, they share the capital gained with their own token shareholders (proportional to how much equity each shareholder holds).

When capital is gained by selling equity in a personal token, the Network can automatically distribute the capital gained to shareholders because the source of truth for personal tokens is within the Network (in the personal token ledger). But, when a personal token owner sells equity in a company, how will that capital gained be distributed to shareholders?

<SyncScene />

#### At launch:

In the early days of the Network, users will have to self-report capital gains from selling equity in companies.

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/), etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

#### Future implementation:

The Network must become be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies. This eliminates the messy, not-instantaneous, self-reporting, since smart contracts will distribute capital gains instantaneously to personal token shareholders. <Annotation>we may need to work with the government and help shape policies that allow shifting the source of truth for equity in companies on chain. this may take a while</Annotation>

### Access

#### At launch:

A web app (built and maintained by the core team) to access the Network and its functionality.

#### Future implementation:

Anyone can create and publish their client to access the Network. We should see a rich ecosystem of clients each with their own design decisions that cater to different audiences.

### Support

Raising capital through personal tokens / investing in personal tokens will be a new behavior for most users, therefore, it's important that we spend more time than we think we should in order to make understanding the process simple, and to feel that we have their backs in case something goes wrong, by being quick to personally jump in and help resolve any issues they may have.

This personal, human, high touch approach to support is critical to build sufficient trust in the Network.

Until the Network achieves critical mass, users transacting in the Network are not only betting on each other, but also on the idea of personal tokens and the team building the Network. We'll express our immense gratitude through our unparalleled support.

### Legal

A personal token is a new kind of financial instrument, and therefore, a large part of its implementation is in the legal instrument that represents a personal token and supports its functionality.

I'm working with lawyers to draft a clear legal implementation plan and will share details when the time is right. We will approach regulations head on by treating personal tokens as securities and working to remain compliant with all laws and regulations surrounding securities such as filing a Form D for each fundraise, etc.

In addition to the legal implementation, we'll need to make compliance simple for users of the Network, through education, standardized templates and filing on behalf of users wherever possible.

In order to be legally compliant, at launch, the Network will likely need to be restricted to users in the United States of America. Why restrict to the US at launch? Firstly, we won't have the bandwidth to handle regulations in multiple countries, and it doesn't make sense to delay launching the Network until we do. And second, the US has the greatest concentration of highly ambitious individuals in the world today, making it a natural starting point if we have to launch in a single country. <Annotation>usage is how we touch base with reality. we can't afford to delay grounding our ideas in reality in order to try and launch in multiple regions at the start</Annotation>

## IV. Governance

### Network token

In order to build a Network that lasts, its users need to be incentivized to preserve and evolve it. **Users need a stake in the overall Network itself**.

I propose a "Network token". The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:
1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

Therefore, the Network token acts as an index of all of the personal tokens in the Network.

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

<NetworkTokenScene />

The wallet associated with the Network token will be treated as the Network's treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for the Network's functions: legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network. <Annotation>over time, the distribution percentage (how much of capital gains is distributed to Network token holders vs. how much is preserved in treasury) will become more skewed towards distributing to shareholders over retaining in treasury</Annotation>

### Core team

The core team will be responsible for designing, implementing and iterating on the Network. This will include people from a variety of backgrounds: design, engineering, legal.

The wallet associated with the Network token will act as the treasury for this team who can use the money in the wallet towards building the Network.

This team will remain as small as possible. In the early days, in order to make execution efficient, this core team will have authority on how it prioritizes its work. Over time, power will be more decentralized - enabling every user to have a say in key decisions about how the Network functions, which features to prioritize, and in general, how the capital in the treasury is allocated.

### Promoting competition

The greatest cause for the failure of a team is complacency. We are our worst enemies.

Complacency is a natural reaction to success. In order for the Network to last, it's not enough to have the right design & implementation. The most important factor is for it to have a culture that never becomes complacent.

Unfortunately, I suspect this is a near impossible task because mental balance is elusive: the mind is either paranoid or complacent, and seldom at the optimal. <Annotation>anyone who has done anything nontrivial understands this truth experientially</Annotation>

Therefore, in order to build a Network that lasts, we must consistently strive to reduce the barrier to compete with us. Constant competitive pressure is a healthy mental stabilizer that prevents complacency. It's far easier to manage the paranoia that we will be outcompeted, than it is to manage the complacency that comes with success.

What would this look like?
1. Open source code. Anyone should be able to "fork" the network and spin up their own version of it quickly.
2. Make it easy for users of the Network to move to a competing network, or even operate in multiple networks simultaneously if they want to.
3. Publishing discoveries to the world as soon as we have them - especially if we believe it will help competition.

## V. Notes

### Q&A

#### "Owning an individual" through their personal token is appalling. Are you bringing back slavery?
Ownership of equity in a personal token DOES NOT imply any ownership of the person who owns the personal token in any way, shape, or form. Also, unlike company shareholders, personal token shareholders have no voting rights over what the personal token owner should do.

Also, the capital raised through personal tokens doesn't need to be paid back to investors. I find the fact that most students need to take on debt in order to finance their learning to be appalling. Debt cripples the mind. Raising capital through personal tokens instead of through debt actually enables an individual to be more more free.

#### What would be the standard investment amount?
As with investing in early stage startups, personal token valuations for the first fundraise will likely default to an soft standard (a standard that is recommended, but not enforced). I predict that will be somewhere between $50k - $500k for 1% of equity.

This default valuation is greater than the default US startup valuation (i.e. $500k for 3 -  7% equity in the US) because a personal token captures value from *all* of the companies its owner starts / works at in the future, as opposed to a single company - hence the default valuation for a personal token should be higher than it is for a startup.

#### Privacy: will everything in the personal token ledger be public information? 
Can anyone learn about valuations, fundraising histories for any user in the Network?

Users should have control over how much information about their personal tokens, fundraising history, valuations, transactions are public (or at least, how much of it can be associated with their real world identity). Insufficient privacy can even be a security issue. That being said, potential investors should have access to previous fundraising round information before they make their decision to invest or not.

#### Why capture percentage from capital gains instead of salaries?
Most of the wealth generated is through equity in companies, therefore an individual's economic potential is best represented by their equity in companies, not by their salaries. <Annotation>and over time, i predict that most wealth generated will be through equity in personal tokens, not companies</Annotation>
