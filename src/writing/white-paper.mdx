## I. Intro

A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's economic potential.

Similar to how companies issue shares to raise capital, individuals can raise capital by selling shares in their person token to investors. When the personal token owner makes money from selling their investments in companies or other personal tokens, shareholders in their personal token get their share of the profits. In other words, a personal token's value is grounded in its owner's stakes in companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially the kind of talent that is underrated and overlooked. **Therefore, personal tokens incentivize democratizing opportunity.**

In this paper I've attempted to show how I see personal tokens working, and how to implement them. This is an early draft. I'd appreciate your feedback.

## II. How it works

### The Network

This system works as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I’ll refer to this system as the “Network”.

Both the individual raising capital, and the investor investing in others will need their own personal token in the Network to be able to transact with each other.

### A personal token

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token (as number of shares out of total shares available).
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network - i.e. in the "real world") that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

</Card>

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. A user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. For example, if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice’s personal token.

When I use to the word "user" I'm referring to the person behind the personal token who is acting in the Network through their personal token.

Personal tokens are fundamentally different from companies. While company shareholders can vote on company decisions, personal token holders don't have voting rights over the person they invest in. When you own someone's personal token, you don't 'own' any part of that actual person, you only get a share of the wealth they create.

A personal token's value comes from how much wealth people think its owner will make in the future. For example: Amy sells shares of her personal token to investors. When Amy does well and shows she can be successful, people believe she'll create more wealth in the future, so her token becomes more valuable. But if Amy keeps struggling and doesn't show promise, her token loses value.

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising rounds. Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime is important because it gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

Users can raise money by selling shares of their personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds". Having set fundraising rounds, instead of letting anyone buy or sell at any time, gives users greater control over who owns shares of their personal token.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors.

The owner of a personal token has the final say about who can be a shareholder of their personal token. When a fundraising round is completed, the Network applies the transaction: money is transferred, and ownership information is updated.

### Invest

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or have someone they know apply to invest. All transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network. <Annotation>A token holder is incentivized to not be a menace by unfairly rejecting all sales because that would likely spook existing and future investors, and tarnish their reputation.</Annotation>

### Capital distribution

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

When someone sells their equity - whether it's in another personal token or in a company outside the Network - the capital gained from that sale are shared among all shareholders of their personal token. Each shareholder receives capital proportional to the equity they hold.

<CapitalGainsAnimation />

Capital gains from selling equity (whether in companies or in personal tokens) flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network. 

For example, if Alice holds Bob's personal token, and Bob holds Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (which includes Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (which includes Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value.

### Notes

- [Pro rata rights](https://www.angellist.com/learn/pro-rata-rights).
- Min / max investment amount - to give fundraising user control over how many investors will participate in round.
- Minimum percentage of equity a user needs in their own personal token.
- Capped returns? For example, if an investor makes 1000x returns from a personal token, should their equity in that personal token be returned to its owner?

### Examples

Bob, a high school student, runs a podcast in which he interviews interesting scientists. He's good at choosing guests and asking engaging questions, which has helped him build a small but dedicated audience. Ryan, who hosts a popular podcast, sees Bob's talent and offers him a deal: $50,000 in exchange for 1% of Bob's personal token. Ryan is financially incentivized to help Bob succeed. With this money, Bob can focus completely on improving his podcast instead of having to work a part-time job - accelerating his learning.

Amy, an undergraduate student studying nuclear power, published a paper that didn't get much attention at a major conference. However, Maya, who runs a nuclear energy startup, saw potential in Amy's work. Maya decided to invest in Amy's personal token, which allows Amy to continue her research freely without worrying about getting grants (which was difficult because Amy's research direction was unpopular).

Maya feels confident about this investment because she believes that though Amy's research is unpopular today, it will be the standard in the future, making Amy incredibly valuable to the world. With the capital raised, Amy can now pursue her research intuitions without being held back by the status quo.


## III. Implementation

This chapter focuses on implementing the Network _at launch_, and not how it ought to be implemented later on as the Network matures. In other words, this is the implementation of the "MVP": minimum viable product.

### Network at launch

**1. Core functionality**: everything in the "How it works" chapter above - the ability to join the Network by creating a personal token, raise capital through discrete fundraising rounds, invest in personal tokens, and sell your equity in a personal token to others.

**2. Selective admission**: the core team will vet the initial set of users to ensure that they're "high quality" individuals who are ambitious and operate on long time horizons. Early users will have an outsized impact on how the Network evolves, so it's important to get the right people on board: people who are also invested in the system of investing through personal tokens, in addition to wanting to invest in individuals.

**3. Centralized power to tackle fraud**: the core team will have the authority to ban users who try to lie / manipulate for profit. Users can complain to the core team about anything they're suspicious about, and the team will evaluate and take action. In the early days, even a small suspicion will be enough to blanket ban users because we won't have the resources to deal with each situation in a nuanced way. Since there will be a lot of capital changing hands for each fundraise, it's better to be safe than sorry.

That being said, each decision to ban a user will be transparent: it will be recorded on the personal token itself (on the public ledger) with an explanation +/ evidence for why the user was banned.

As mentioned above, as the Network matures, this reputation system must become more decentralized and nuanced such that users are impacted according to the severity of their actions. As decentralization happens, users that might have been banned earlier, will have more ways to challenge their bans and rejoin the Network.

**4. A web application** for users to access the Network and its functionality.

**5. High touch onboarding and support**. Raising capital through personal tokens / investing in personal tokens will be a new behavior for most users, therefore, it's important that we spend more time than we think we should to ensure that everything makes sense to users, and be quick to personally jump in and help resolve any issues they may have. This personal, human, high touch approach early on is critical to build trust in the Network. Until the Network achieves critical mass, users transacting in the Network are not only betting on each other, but also on the technology of personal tokens, as well as the team building the Network. We ought to be grateful for their bet on us, and express our gratefulness through our service.

### Technical

Network will be implemented on: [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/) (best developer experience, fastest growing ecosystem & the org behind it - Coinbase - is solid).

Transactions will use [USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) to eliminate unnecessary variables in personal token valuations, minimize volatility.

### Legal

A personal token is a new kind of financial instrument, and therefore, a large part of its implementation is in the legal instrument that represents a personal token and supports its functionality.

I'm working with lawyers to draft a clear legal implementation plan and will share details when the time is right. We will approach regulations head on by treating personal tokens as securities and working to remain compliant with all laws and regulations surrounding securities such as filing a Form D for each fundraise, etc.

In addition to the legal implementation, we'll need to make compliance simple for users of the Network, through education, standardized templates and filing on behalf of users wherever possible.

## IV. Governance

### Network token

In order to build a Network that lasts, its users need to be incentivized to preserve and evolve it. In other words, **users need a stake in the overall Network itself**.

I propose a "Network token" to enable people to hold a stake in the entire Network itself.

The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

Therefore, the Network token's portfolio represents the Network itself.

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

<NetworkTokenScene />

The wallet associated with the Network token will be treated the Network's treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network.

### Core team

The core team will be responsible for designing, implementing and iterating on the Network. This will include people from a variety of backgrounds: design, engineering, legal.

The wallet associated with the Network token will act as the treasury for this team who can use the money in the wallet towards building the Network.

This team will remain as small as possible. In the early days, in order to make execution efficient, this core team will have authority on how it prioritizes its work. Over time, power will be more decentralized - enabling every user to have a say in key decisions about how the Network functions, which features to prioritize, and in general, how the capital in the treasury is allocated.

### Promoting competition

The greatest cause for the failure of a group is complacency. We are our worst enemies.

Complacency is a natural reaction to success. In order for the Network to last, it's not enough to have the right design & implementation. The most important factor is having a culture that never becomes complacent.

Unfortunately, I suspect this is a near impossible task because mental balance is elusive: the mind is either paranoid or complacent, and seldom at the optimal. Anyone who has done anything nontrivial understands this truth experientially.

Therefore, in order to build a Network that lasts, we must consistently strive to reduce the barrier to compete with us. Constant competitive pressure is a healthy mental stabilizer that prevents complacency. It's far easier to manage the paranoia that we will be outcompeted, than it is to manage the complacency that comes with success.

What would this look like?

1. Open source code. Anyone should be able to "fork" the network and spin up their own version of it quickly.
2. Make it easy for users of the Network to move to a competing network, or even operate in multiple networks simultaneously if they want to.
3. A culture of publishing our discoveries to the world as soon as we have them - especially if we believe it will help competition.

## V. Notes

### Privacy

I predict that as personal tokens become popular, people will not mind their personal token valuations and transaction histories to be public information.

But, in the early days, users should have control over how much information about their personal tokens, fundraising history, valuations, transactions are public (or at least, how much of it can be associated with their real world identity). Insufficient privacy can even be a security issue. That being said, potential investors should have access to previous fundraising round information before they make their decision to invest or not.

We'll need to design a system that takes these nuances into account.
