## I. Intro

A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's portfolio of equity holdings - both in companies and in other personal tokens.

A personal token can be divided into shares and sold to investors, who then become entitled to a portion of the capital gained by the token owner when they sell their equity in their assets (companies and other personal tokens) - proportional to how much equity the investor holds in the personal token. Investors can also sell their equity in personal tokens to others.

Personal tokens enable individuals to raise capital earlier: even before they know exactly how they’ll create value in the world. Selling equity in personal tokens, instead of paying up front, will become the most popular way for bright young individuals to finance their learning. Personal tokens amplify the incentives that will democratize opportunity.

Through personal tokens, those with the greatest potential - regardless of socioeconomic background - will be able to raise capital and resources that will enable them to do great work.

As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will become more complex, creative, and will increasingly follow a power law distribution of outcomes: fewer will capture the majority of the outcomes, and the median outcome will fall. As a result, it will no longer make sense for people to shell out money for education because most won't be able to earn back their investments on a reasonable timeline, if at all. Therefore, raising venture capital by selling equity in personal tokens will be the best (and eventually, only) way to finance learning. ([my previous essay](https://www.karthikuppu.com/vc-learning) in which I explain why I believe this).

Without being able to raise money through personal tokens, opportunity becomes concentrated in the hands of the wealthy: those who can afford to pay for high quality training, or resources, because they don’t have the pressure to earn back their investments.

Democratizing opportunity isn’t just the “right thing to do”, it accelerates innovation, growth, and prosperity. Democratizing opportunity pushes humanity forward. Our ability to tackle our greatest problems depends on our ability to discover and enable those with the natural talent to tackle those problems. A system of personal tokens creates an economic incentive to discover those with the greatest potential - in any domain - and to arm them with the resources to succeed at what they want to do.

## II. How it works

### The Network

This system would be implemented as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I’ll refer to this system as the “Network”

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents the following information:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- how many shares are available (pieces it can be broken into).
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token.
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network) that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. It naturally follows that a user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. I.e. if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice’s personal token.

### Shares

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising “rounds”.

Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime (like public markets) gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors. A fundraising round is private by default (people who don’t have the link to it will not know it exists).

They can also make their round "public" such that it can be discovered by other users in the Network. Someone who discovers a public round on the Network and wants to invest in it will require the owner (of the personal token they want to invest in) to approve them.

The user who is fundraising has the final say about who can be an investor in their personal token. A user can cancel an active fundraising round in case they change their minds.

When a round is completed, the Network completes the transaction: respective wallet values for all personal tokens involved in the transaction are updated, and so is the information about who owns how much of which personal tokens.

### Valuation

The value of a personal token depends on what the market thinks is the owner’s potential to create long-term economic value. Let’s say Amy raises capital from investors by selling equity in her personal token. As Amy works to create value and influence the world, her perceived economic potential will increase, and the value of her personal token will rise. Similarly, if Amy consistently fails to show potential to create value, the value of her personal token falls.

### Manage relationships

In the Network, users can give their personal token shareholders investor updates, as well as direct message other users.

### Invest

Investors are just users in the Network who also have their own personal tokens that represent their ownership in other personal tokens and in companies (that exist outside of the Network).

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), or apply to invest (when the investor discovers an active round in the Network), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

Unlike in companies, voting rights don't make sense in the context of personal tokens. An investor should not be able to force the action of the users associated with the personal tokens the investor has equity in. Why? Because a company is an entity that exist independently of people: its owners can change, it can be created, destroyed, and people can directly own companies by buying equity in them. But, shareholders of a personal token do not directly “own” the person behind the token in any way, shape, or form.

TODO: talk about how this is the first time you can just “invest in an individual” - directly, and not through the things that they create. this is somewhat novel.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or directly transfer them to specific buyers they've identified. However, all transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

Capital gains from selling equity (whether in companies or in personal tokens) flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network. For example, if Alice holds Bob's personal token, and Bob holds Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (including Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (like Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value. This mirrors how corporate structures handle distributions: shareholders of a company that owns shares in another company don't automatically receive distributions when the subsidiary company sells assets.

### Additional details

- [Pro rata rights](https://www.angellist.com/learn/pro-rata-rights).
- Min / max investment amount - to give fundraising user control over how many investors will participate in round.
- Minimum percentage of equity a user needs in their own personal token.
- Capped returns? For example, if an investor makes 1000x returns from a personal token, should their equity in that personal token be returned to its owner?

## IV. Design

### Admission

### Sufficient decentralization

There are 3 types of functions in the Network:

1. **Tied to the network**. There are no 3rd party implementations available. Designed and implemented by the core team with feedback from the users in the Network, and possibly with Network participation in shaping features (for example, through voting). To fundamentally change these functions, you would need to start a new Network.
2. **Tied to the client.** Any user can create their own implementations for these functions and expose them to other users through an open marketplace. These 3rd party implementations are built on permission-less decentralized primitives: i.e. no centralized authority can censor, block, and 3rd party developers need no one’s permission to build and distribute their versions of these functions.
3. **Peer to peer:** these functions are between individual users of the Network without interference from any central authority.

### Network token

The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

Therefore, the Network token's portfolio represents the Network itself.

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

TODO: animation that visualizes how the Network token accrues value.

The wallet associated with the Network token is considered the treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network.

### Tackling fraud

By fraud, I mean any kind of manipulation / deception with the intention to profit.

**Investor confidence is critical for the Network to survive**. If investors feel that there's too much fraud on the network, or feel like they don't have a good recourse if they’re scammed, they won’t invest.

Fraud could be:

- **Identity fraud**: A user who has already created a personal token and raised money in the past creates another personal token on the Network in order to raise more money while hiding their history. This is something that a user who has already raised capital and has consistently failed to create any value would want to do to cover up their poor track record.
- [Rug pulls](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/what-is-a-rug-pull-and-how-to-avoid-it): a user raising capital by fabricating a pitch without actually having the intention to create long-term value. They raise money and aren’t seen again.
- **Avoiding capital gains distribution**: A user, after raising capital (and therefore has investors who own some equity in their personal token), intentionally fails to report selling company equity (outside of the Network) in order to avoid having to pay their investors their proportional share of the capital gained from the equity sale.

In order to make sure that a user can only have one personal token and can't hide their track record from investors, the Network will need to verify the human behind the user: via government ID verification, or perhaps by taking advantage of something like [WorldID](https://world.org/world-id).

In order to prevent rug pulls, it would help to have the backing of courts. This requires treating personal tokens as securities and complying with the regulations around securities. In cases of fraud, investors (or the Network’s legal counsel) can then file lawsuits under federal securities laws ([particularly Rule 10b-5](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule10b5.asp)) for material misrepresentations or omissions made during fundraising. In the early stages, to minimize legal complexity, restricting the Network to only users in the US makes the most sense because of its ambitious talent pool and quality of investors.

To prevent avoiding capital gains distribution, the Network could require users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their tax returns annually (which would reflect any capital gains).

Yet, prevention is far more valuable than cure. Having a strong community of high quality, ambitious users who genuinely want to do great work is critically important. Ambitious individuals operate on long time horizons and wouldn’t want to damage their reputation for some measly short-term gains. Therefore, the Network will need to be able to penalize bad actors \*\*\*\*such that they can’t participate in the Network.

Investors who believe they’ve been scammed can flag it and the fundraise will be investigated by the fraud authority: a team that works for the Network that is responsible for identifying fraud and taking measures to penalize bad actors.

Assessing whether fraud actually took place can be difficult. In order to have sufficient information to assess claims, it would help to encourage personal token owners and their shareholders to communicate within the Network itself, so that in the case that someone claims fraud, the Network’s fraud authority can inspect the communication between the parties, do research in the real world to validate claims, and come to a decision on whether it believes fraud took place and to what degree.

When this authority decides someone is a bad actor, they can freeze the bad actor’s personal token on Network, and the bad actor would be barred from participating in the future.

Blocked users should have a way to challenge decisions. When this happens, the evidence and argument produced by the fraud authority would be shared to a sufficient number of Network users who could vote on whether fraud actually took place (and thereby whether the user can be let back in or not).

Centralization (with a decentralized means to correct mistakes) is required in the early days in order to swiftly block bad actors so that they don’t do more damage to the Network. As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, this function can be more decentralized: i.e. instead of giving a small group of people power, Network users instead vote on the prompts & examples taught to the AI to determine what is fraud on the network and what isn’t. Therefore, **I predict degree of decentralization to be proportional to the degree of intelligence of AI.**

We could also introduce a voting system to determine who is a part of this fraud authority. This will be important because there can (and will likely be) bad actors in the fraud team as well.

### Syncing off chain assets

The source of truth for equity in companies lies outside of the network:

### Promoting competition

I predict in the first few decades of this system, multiple Networks will co-exist - each with different design decisions. Eventually, the Network that best optimizes for total market capitalization, will be the single winning Network that will win over the rest (extreme power law distribution).

### Governance

## V. Implementation

### Overview

Network will be implemented on: [Ethereum +](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [Base](https://www.base.org/) (best developer experience, fastest growing ecosystem & the org behind it - Coinbase - is solid).

Transactions will use [USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) to eliminate unnecessary variables in personal token valuations, minimize volatility.
