## I. Intro

A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's economic potential.

Similar to how companies issue shares to raise capital, individuals can divide their personal token into shares and raise capital by selling shares to investors. These shareholders become entitled to a proportional share of capital gains when the personal token owner sells their equity in companies or other personal tokens. Therefore, a personal token's value is grounded in its owner's ownership of companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially the kind of talent that is underrated and overlooked. Personal tokens enable high-potential individuals to raise capital to fund their ambitious projects and learning, much earlier in their careers.

I believe personal tokens (or whatever they will be called) will become a core feature of society: most people will finance their learning by selling equity in their personal tokens instead of paying up front for education (which is often done by taking on debt).

As AI becomes more powerful, our work will become far more creative, eliminating most safe, stable career paths. Paying up front to learn will not be viable because most will not be able to earn back their investments on a predictable, reasonable timeline, if at all. In such a world, raising capital through personal tokens by giving up some equity in future outcomes, instead of taking on debt, will become the best way to finance learning. [further_reading]

Needing to take on debt to finance learning concentrates opportunity in the hands of the few who can pay to learn without worrying about earning it back.

On the other hand, personal tokens create economic incentives to democratize opportunity at scale. Investors are incentivized to discover and invest in individuals with potential - regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds. The craving to make a profit is a far more reliable, robust forcing function to distribute capital to those who deserve it, than benevolence. And importantly, the individuals raising capital aren't burdened by debt.

In the [age of intelligence](https://ia.samaltman.com), the communities, countries, and societies that will prosper the most will be ones run on personal tokens. We're on the cusp of an explosion in artificial intelligence, and therefore NOW is the time to bring this system of personal tokens to the world.

In this paper I've attempted to show how I see personal tokens working, and how to implement them. This is a very early draft. I'd appreciate your feedback.

## II. How it works

### The Network

This system would be implemented as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I’ll refer to this system as the “Network”.

Both the individual raising capital, and the investor investing in others will need their own personal token in the Network to be able to transact in the Network.

### A personal token

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token (as number of shares out of total shares available).
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network - i.e. in the "real world") that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

<Card caption="A personal token with shareholders and a portfolio of other personal tokens and companies.">
  <PersonalTokenComp />
</Card>

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. It naturally follows that a user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. For example, if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice’s personal token.

When I refer to the word "user" I'm referring to the person behind the personal token who's acting in the Network through their personal token.

Unlike in companies, voting rights don't make sense in the context of personal tokens. Personal token shareholders should not be able to force the action of the owner of the personanl token. Why? Because a company is an entity that exist independently of people: its owners can change, it can be created, destroyed, and people can directly own companies by buying equity in them. But, shareholders of a personal token do not directly “own” the person behind the token in any way, shape, or form, they only own a part of the economic outcomes generated by the owner.

The value of a personal token depends on what the market thinks is the owner’s potential to create long-term economic value. Let’s say Amy raises capital from investors by selling equity in her personal token. As Amy works to create value and influence the world, her perceived economic potential will increase, and the value of her personal token will rise. Similarly, if Amy consistently fails to show potential to create value, the value of her personal token falls.

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising rounds. Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime is important because it gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors. A fundraising round is private by default (people who don’t have the link to it will not know it exists).

They can also make their round "public" such that it can be discovered by other users in the Network. Someone who discovers a public round on the Network and wants to invest in it will require the owner of the personal token they want to invest in to approve them.

The user who is fundraising has the final say about who can be an investor in their personal token. A user can cancel an active fundraising round in case they change their minds.

When a round is completed, the Network completes the transaction: respective wallet values for all personal tokens involved in the transaction are updated, and so is the information about who owns how much of which personal tokens.

### Communicate

Within the Network, users can share updates with their shareholders, as well as direct message other users.

### Invest

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), or apply to invest (when the investor discovers an active round in the Network), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or directly transfer them to specific buyers they've identified. However, all transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

<CapitalGainsAnimation />

Capital gains from selling equity (whether in companies or in personal tokens) flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network. For example, if Alice holds Bob's personal token, and Bob holds Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (including Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (like Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value. This mirrors how corporate structures handle distributions: shareholders of a company that owns shares in another company don't automatically receive distributions when the subsidiary company sells assets.

### Additional details

- [Pro rata rights](https://www.angellist.com/learn/pro-rata-rights).
- Min / max investment amount - to give fundraising user control over how many investors will participate in round.
- Minimum percentage of equity a user needs in their own personal token.
- Capped returns? For example, if an investor makes 1000x returns from a personal token, should their equity in that personal token be returned to its owner?

### Examples

Bob is a high schooler with a podcast in which he interviews people he finds interesting. He demonstrates a knack for asking the right questions & choosing interesting people to interview. Ryan, A famous podcaster recognizes that Bob may have a special talent and decides to invest $50k in Bob in exchange for a 3% equity in Bob's personal token.

Ryan is now incentivized to mentor Bob and help him succeed. Ryan creates wealth when Bob does. Bob can now afford to dedicate all of his time towards his podcast and will likely improve much faster than if he had to also get a part time to job to help him survive and invest in his podcast.

Amy is an undergrad researching nuclear power. She just published a paper that was met with a lukewarm reception at a popular conference, but caught the eye of Maya, a startup CEO building a nuclear power plant. Maya finds Amy's research promising and invests in Amy's personal token to enable Amy to follow her natural curiosity in her research without worrying about grants which she's struggling to get because the community doesn't value her research.

Maya doesn't consider her investment in Amy to be that risky because Maya is convinced that nuclear power will create incredible economic value within a couple of decades, and that the skills Amy will build through her research - regardless of how successful her current research direction is - will make Amy very wealthy, and therefore will make Maya wealthy.

## III. System

### Trust

Trust is the foundation for growth. Users in the Network must trust that:
1. the equity they hold in personal tokens will be honored. (i.e the legal, technical implementation is solid).
2. the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make decisions is accurate and aligned with reality.
3. the Network will last. Without the fear that they may wake up one day to see the Network destroyed due to the actions of a stupid individual or authority.
4. the majority of users in the Network are ambitious, long-term oriented individuals with high integrity, not fraudsters looking to run away with the capital they raise without any intention to do what they said they would.

The success of the Network depends on cultivating and protecting such trust, because without sufficient trust investors will not want to participate.

### Tackling fraud

Effectively tackling fraud is required to cultivate trust . By "fraud" I mean misrepresenting reality with the intention to profit.

In the Network, misrepresentation can be in the following ways:
1. Saying you are who you're not.
2. Saying you've accomplished things that you actually haven't.
3. Saying you want to do something with the capital you will raise without actually having the intention to do it.
4. Omitting some (or all) of your ownership of companies outside of the Network.

Each form of misrepresentation has a likely cause. Those who don't identify themselves accurately are likely trying shed the burden of their poor track record, or history of actions that hurt their chances to raise capital. Those who bloat what they've accomplished, or tell ambitious stories of how they'll use capital raised without intending to spend it that way are trying to cheat investors out of money. Those who omit their ownership of companies outside of the Network are likely trying to skip paying the appropriate share of capital gains to their personal token shareholders when they sell equity in companies outside of the Network.

Naturally there are varying degrees to fraud: some misrepresentations are far more harmful than others. It's also possible to make accidents. Intention matters.

The best way to dis-incentivize fraud is to:
1. Ensure users of the Network have high ambition.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors.

### Ambition

Sufficient ambition is a necessary pre-requisite to minimizing fraud because the possibility of a tarnished reputation alone doesn't dis-incentivize an individual from acting fraudulently if they're not ambitious.

Ambitious individuals operate on long-time horizons and understand that a strong reputation is critical for them to achieve their goals. *(note: by reputation I don't mean being liked by others, but rather being seen as an individual who doesn't lie, does what they say they will, honors commitments and generally is a person of strong integrity.)* Therefore, a Network in which all users are genuinely highly ambitious will naturally have far, far less fraud than one with moderate / low ambition users.

How do we ensure that users in the platform are genuinely highly ambitious?

In order to ensure that the Network consists of ambitious, long-term oriented individuals, it's tempting to be selective about who can get into the Network. But, this will backfire because it means the Network will operate at the wrong level of abstraction: instead of being an open platform that facilitates a marketplace of notions about what it means to be "investable" / "ambitious", it operates at the level of a selective sub-Network.

The Network should NOT be selective about who can join the Network beyond the bare minimum such as barring individuals who have been convicted of fraud in the world, as well as meeting any legal / regulatory requirements such as minimum age, etc.

By making the Network itself un-selective, the burden to ensure that users are genuinely ambitious falls on the investors. Investors are incentivized to only invest in the most ambitious individuals (since their greatest returns will come from the most ambitious), and therefore, there's a forcing function to make the entire Network more ambitious in order to be able to raise capital.

Now we need a system to swiftly, accurately tarnish reputations of bad actors. We need a reputation system.

### Reputation

If a user acts fraudulently, their reputation should be negatively impacted.

What would a good reputation system look like?

A good reputation system would have a sufficiently granular measure of reputation, perhaps as a score out of 100, to be able to represent the subtle differences between different kinds of fraud.

A good reputation system swiftly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality.

A good reputation system would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network. For example: raising capital and running with it instead of doing what you said you would when you pitch yourself is an action that could greatly erode trust in the Network. On the other hand, failing to report capital gains from selling equity in a company (out of the Network) is far less damaging. These actions should not be penalized equally.

A good reputation system would interpret the rubric accurately for each case. Any good rubric will have room for interpretation so that it can generalize to many different scenarios. A good reputation system would apply the rubric consistently across cases.

A good reputation system would make a user's reputation score available to all who may want to work with them, to enable users to make more informed decisions.

A good reputation system would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.

A good reputation system would be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the impact of the biases (which are bound to exist, as well as grow over time) of a single authority.

Implementing such a reputation system is a massive undertaking in and of itself. Fortunately, we'll only need a small subset of features to be able to successfully launch the Network, while leaving the design and implementation of a full-fledged reputation system for later - when the Network is more mature.

At launch, I propose the following system: any user in the Network can flag fraudulent activity, and a centralized reputation authority would assess the claim. If it sees merit in it, the authority would ban the bad actor from the Network.

### Synchronization

A key functionality of personal tokens is capital gains distribution to personal token shareholders when the personal token owner sells their equity in other personal tokens / companies - proportional to how much equity the shareholder holds.

This distribution of capital gains happens immediately when the equity sold is in a personal token because the capital gains happens within the Network itself, therefore the distribution can happen automatically (programmatically - whenever equity in a personal token is sold - the capital to be distributed to shareholders goes directly into their wallets, it never even reaches the personal token owner).

But, we need a way to know when equity in companies is sold by a personal token owner who has shareholders because this transaction happens out of the Network.

<SyncScene />

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as Angellist, etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

In the long-run, the Network should aim to be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies as well in order to eliminate relying on self-reporting by individuals. I have no good ideas how to approach this in the short-term, but I predict that there will be some ways to make this happen as the Network matures and reaches a critical mass in number of users and market capitalization.


 
## IV. Governance

### Sufficient decentralization

**A key point of this section is to highlight that anyone can build on top of the primitives. i.e. you can build "collectives": YC type groups that operate on the Network with collectives specific tooling and UX, etc. it is an open field and 3rd party developers' house can't just be removed by some central authority.**

There are 3 types of functions in the Network:

1. **Tied to the network**. There are no 3rd party implementations available. Designed and implemented by the core team with feedback from the users in the Network, and possibly with Network participation in shaping features (for example, through voting). To fundamentally change these functions, you would need to start a new Network.
2. **Tied to the client.** Any user can create their own implementations for these functions and expose them to other users through an open marketplace. These 3rd party implementations are built on permission-less decentralized primitives: i.e. no centralized authority can censor, block, and 3rd party developers need no one’s permission to build and distribute their versions of these functions.
3. **Peer to peer:** these functions are between individual users of the Network without interference from any central authority.

#### 🌐 Tied to network:

- **Admission**: verifying and accepting people into the Network
- **Fraud prevention**: assessing fraud complaints and penalizing bad actors

#### 📱 Tied to client:

- **Discovery feeds**: ways in which users of the Network can discover each other. For example: through a feed of active fundraising rounds

#### 👥 Peer to peer:

- **Raise capital**
- **Invest**
- **Sell on chain equity**

### Network token

The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

Therefore, the Network token's portfolio represents the Network itself.

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

<NetworkTokenScene />

The wallet associated with the Network token is considered the treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network.

### Promoting competition

I predict in the first few decades of this system, multiple Networks will co-exist - each with different design decisions. Eventually, the Network that best optimizes for total market capitalization, will be the single winning Network that will win over the rest (extreme power law distribution).

### Governance

- Core team: will be kept very, very small. not a democracy, there is a clear leader and person held accountable for all actions.
- Legal counsel - talk about how we will need to help create the legal framework to enable personal tokens => meet the legal system where it is + help define the future.

### Artificial intelligence
Replace human power with AI. As AI becomes more competent, we'll have a more decentralized distribution of power through voting on the rules, prompts, examples, and models for the AI system that will increasingly make decisions that power the network. -> this is a very powerful idea that i'd like to expand on later, but keep it concise and packed in this white paper now (or perhaps you can expand it right now?).

## V. Implementation

implementation consists of legal + technical.

The accurate spec (every detail required to implement the Network: the legal contracts, data structures, smart contracts, etc.) will be covered elsewhere - after achieving sufficient clarity about the features of the Network that we want to create.

This section is just an overview with some ideas about how we may approach implementing this Network. I expect many details to change.

### Legal

### Technical

Network will be implemented on: [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/) (best developer experience, fastest growing ecosystem & the org behind it - Coinbase - is solid).

Transactions will use [USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) to eliminate unnecessary variables in personal token valuations, minimize volatility.
