## I. Intro

A personal token is a financial instrument that represents an individual's economic potential.

Similar to how companies issue shares to raise capital, individuals can raise capital by selling shares in their person token to investors. These shareholders become entitled to a proportional share of capital gains when the personal token owner sells their equity in companies or other personal tokens. In other words, a personal token's value is grounded in its owner's stakes in companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens incentivize discovering and enabling talent - especially the kind of talent that is underrated and overlooked. **Therefore, personal tokens create the economic incentives to democratize opportunity.**

In this paper I've attempted to show how I see personal tokens working, and how to implement them. This is an early draft. I'd appreciate your feedback.

## II. How it works

### The Network

This system would be implemented as a network of personal tokens, along with the metadata required to keep track of who owns how much of what. From here on out I’ll refer to this system as the “Network”.

Both the individual raising capital, and the investor investing in others will need their own personal token in the Network to be able to transact in the Network.

### A personal token

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents:

- the owner of this personal token.
- wallet that stores $. (used to invest in other tokens, and where capital is deposited when a user raises money)
- which personal tokens own how much equity in this personal token (as number of shares out of total shares available).
- assets: the other personal tokens and companies (outside of the Network - i.e. in the "real world") that this personal token holds equity in.
- a history of all the transactions this personal token has been involved in.

<Card caption="A personal token with shareholders and a portfolio of other personal tokens and companies.">
  <PersonalTokenComp />
</Card>

There is no notion of a “user” in the Network. A user is simply represented by their personal token. It naturally follows that a user cannot own more than one personal token. A user holds equity in other personal tokens (by investing in them) **_through_** their personal token. For example, if Alice has 5% equity in Bob’s personal token, Bob’s personal token equity will be represented in the assets of Alice’s personal token.

When I refer to the word "user" I'm referring to the person behind the personal token who's acting in the Network through their personal token.

Unlike in companies, voting rights don't make sense in the context of personal tokens. Personal token shareholders should not be able to force the action of the owner of the personanl token. Why? Because a company is an entity that exist independently of people: its owners can change, it can be created, destroyed, and people can directly own companies by buying equity in them. But, shareholders of a personal token do not directly “own” the person behind the token in any way, shape, or form, they only own a part of the economic outcomes generated by the owner.

The value of a personal token depends on what the market thinks is the owner’s potential to create long-term economic value. Let’s say Amy raises capital from investors by selling equity in her personal token. As Amy works to create value and influence the world, her perceived economic potential will increase, and the value of her personal token will rise. Similarly, if Amy consistently fails to show potential to create value, the value of her personal token falls.

### Raise money

A user can raise capital by selling equity in their personal token through discrete fundraising rounds. Raising money through discrete fundraising rounds rather than allowing anyone to buy / sell anytime is important because it gives individuals greater control over who they allow to have equity in their personal tokens.

When a user initiates a fundraising round, they specify information about the raise, such as:

- Number of shares being offered.
- Price per share.
- Minimum investment amount
- Total fundraising target

A user can share a link to this active fundraising round to people they want as investors. A fundraising round is private by default (people who don’t have the link to it will not know it exists).

The owner of a personal token has the final say about who can be a shareholder of their personal token. A user can cancel an active fundraising round in case they change their minds.

When a round is completed, the Network completes the transaction: respective wallet values for all personal tokens involved in the transaction are updated, and so is the information about who owns how much of which personal tokens.

### Invest

In order for an investor to accept an invitation to invest (when a user sends them an invite link for their round), they need sufficient capital in their personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

### Sell

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a “Sale Request” in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or directly transfer them to specific buyers they've identified. However, all transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.

### Capital distribution

When a user sells their equity in another personal token, or equity in a company (outside of the Network), the capital gained from such a transaction is distributed amongst those who hold equity in this user's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

<CapitalGainsAnimation />

Capital gains from selling equity (whether in companies or in personal tokens) flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network. For example, if Alice holds Bob's personal token, and Bob holds Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (including Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (like Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value. This mirrors how corporate structures handle distributions: shareholders of a company that owns shares in another company don't automatically receive distributions when the subsidiary company sells assets.

### Notes

- [Pro rata rights](https://www.angellist.com/learn/pro-rata-rights).
- Min / max investment amount - to give fundraising user control over how many investors will participate in round.
- Minimum percentage of equity a user needs in their own personal token.
- Capped returns? For example, if an investor makes 1000x returns from a personal token, should their equity in that personal token be returned to its owner?

### Examples

Bob is a high schooler with a podcast in which he interviews people he finds interesting. He demonstrates a knack for asking the right questions & choosing interesting people to interview. Ryan, A famous podcaster recognizes that Bob may have a special talent and decides to invest $50k in Bob in exchange for a 3% equity in Bob's personal token.

Ryan is now incentivized to mentor Bob and help him succeed. Ryan creates wealth when Bob does. Bob can now afford to dedicate all of his time towards his podcast and will likely improve much faster than if he had to also get a part time to job to sustain himself.

Amy is an undergrad researching nuclear power. She just published a paper that was met with a lukewarm reception at a popular conference, but caught the eye of Maya, a startup CEO building a nuclear power plant. Maya finds Amy's research promising and invests in Amy's personal token to enable Amy to follow her natural curiosity in her research without worrying about grants which she's struggling to get because of her unpopular research direction.

Maya doesn't consider her investment in Amy to be that risky because Maya is convinced that nuclear power will create incredible economic value within a couple of decades, and that the skills Amy will build through her research - regardless of how successful her current research direction is - will make Amy very wealthy, and therefore will make Maya wealthy.

## III. Aim

### Democratize opportunity

Our aim is to democratize opportunity.

Personal tokens create the economic incentives to accelerate us towards a world in which every individual has the resources to discover and realize their potentials.

To be clear, this shift has already been happening. While there is still significant inequality of opportunity in the world today, there has not been a better period in human history for someone with little. Most can access troves of knowledge through their smartphones, internet, and now through AI. Innovations in technology promise us a world in which everyone has access to powerful tools to learn and to turn their ideas into reality.

Yet, democratizing access to tools alone doesn't sufficiently democratize opportunity. Individuals require capital _(and often guidance & community)_ to be able to have the space to explore, tinker, discover their innate potentials and to then realize them.

Most people intuitively understand that putting resources in the hands of young people to finance their learning & exploration will lead to greater long-term prosperity for all. But, we consistently fail to transfer sufficient capital to the hands of young people.

Why is that? Those who hold power to allocate such capital: the rich (who can give money from their pockets), and the old (who determine political outcomes in much of the developed world), have no incentive to transfer wealth to the young to fuel their growth.

Grants, scholarships, public policies to transfer capital to the hands of young people rely on goodwill - on the benevolence of individuals (the old and/or rich) - who don't directly benefit from it aside from some public status brownie points for "doing good". It's incredibly foolish to rely on such goodwill to democratize opportunity.

Goodwill doesn't scale because it manifests as a weak, fleeting, inconsistent emotion. We don't have to look far to see why: how often do each of us actually act out of a feeling of goodwill for collective happiness and prosperity? Even when we do feel such goodwill, it's usually fleeting. <Annotation>And often what we think is goodwill is actually something far more selfish (craving for status, recognition, etc.).</Annotation>

Personal tokens create a direct relationship between the future prosperity of the investor and who they're investing in. Future rewards from investing in young people with potential are made clear: invest $x today in someone and if they create great value for the world, you directly profit significantly. These profits aren't blurry: they won't be filtered through a massive centralized government structure that seems to eat up much of the resources it promises to give back to its citizens... the gains come straight into the wallet of investors.

Therefore, personal tokens incentivize investing in young people who have potential - out of the desire for future profits, not out of goodwill.

There is no force more powerful than greed. Greed is anti-fragile: we are greedy in bad times and even more greedy during good times. Greed is consistent: you can always bet on greed. And importantly, greed scales: for every person donating to a scholarship (or grant) program out of goodwill, there will be thousands more who would invest (and invest a lot) in an individual out of the desire for profits.

### Growth

Still, even with the right incentives, opportunity will not be democratized in one sudden swoop. Today, even if every single person with the skills and potential to create value in the world gains access to the resources they need to realize their potential, we can't deny that there is still great inequality of opportunity in childhood. How will we bridge that opportunity gap?

I see democratization of opportunity happening in two phases:

1. **Efficiency**: capital is allocated to overlooked talent who already exist in the world.
2. **Expansion**: capital is allocated towards high quality learning environments for all children to increase overall number of talented individuals who can be invested in down the line.

Phase 2 will start once the talent market is sufficiently efficient and prosperous. The investors who generate strong returns will become more ambitious, and will allocate more capital towards increasing the number of talented individuals they can invest in by investing in systems that benefit children.

Therefore, we accelerate democratization of opportunity by optimizing for economic growth: maximizing the number of personal tokens in the Network, and their valuations. Growth leads to prosperity, which raises ambitions, which will push capital towards bridging opportunity gaps in childhood because that is the final frontier for investors to maximize their long-term returns. <Annotation>ofc, there's a limit to how far we can push equal opportunity. underlying genetic differences that make each of us unique gives some of us natural, "unfair" advantages over others. we will get a glimpse of what those innate advantages are only when all other advantages are sufficiently democratized.</Annotation>

### Trust

Trust is the foundation for the growth of the Network.

Users in the Network must trust that:

1. their ownership of other personal tokens will be honored forever - that they won't wake up one day to find that the system has collapsed taking their wealth with it.
2. the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make decisions is accurate and true (aligned with reality).

For the Network to last, it must be implemented well (in all ways: legal, technological, etc.), and be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the chance of centralized stupidity (either from an individual or authority) to kill it. (I will cover this in in the "Governance" and "Implementation" chapters).

To understand why trust in information is so important, we need to see how lies have the potential to kill the Network.

In the Network, misrepresentation of reality (lies) can be in the following ways:

1. Saying you are who you're not.
2. Saying you've accomplished things that you actually haven't.
3. Saying you want to do something with the capital you will raise without actually having the intention to do it.
4. Omitting some (or all) of your ownership of companies outside of the Network.

Each form of misrepresentation has a likely cause. Those who don't identify themselves accurately are likely trying shed the burden of their poor track record, or history of actions that hurt their chances to raise capital. Those who bloat what they've accomplished, or tell ambitious stories of how they'll use capital raised without intending to spend it that way are trying to cheat investors out of money. Those who omit their ownership of companies outside of the Network are likely trying to skip paying the appropriate share of capital gains to their personal token shareholders when they sell equity in companies outside of the Network.

Naturally there are varying degrees to fraud: some misrepresentations are far more harmful than others. It's also possible to make accidents. Intention matters.

The best way to dis-incentivize fraud is to:

1. Ensure users of the Network have high ambition.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors.

**Therefore, a Network of personal tokens that simply facilitates transactions (buying and selling equity in personal tokens) won't work without the necessary auxiliary functions that minimize fraud and cultivate ambition & trust.**

## IV. Functions

### Reputation

If a user acts fraudulently, their reputation should be negatively impacted.

What would a good reputation system look like?

A good reputation system would have a sufficiently granular measure of reputation, perhaps as a score out of 100, to be able to represent the subtle differences between different kinds of fraud.

A good reputation system swiftly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality.

A good reputation system would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network. For example: raising capital and running with it instead of doing what you said you would when you pitch yourself is an action that could greatly erode trust in the Network. On the other hand, failing to report capital gains from selling equity in a company (out of the Network) is far less damaging. These actions should not be penalized equally.

A good reputation system would interpret the rubric accurately for each case. Any good rubric will have room for interpretation so that it can generalize to many different scenarios. A good reputation system would apply the rubric consistently across cases.

A good reputation system would make a user's reputation score available to all who may want to work with them, to enable users to make more informed decisions.

A good reputation system would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.

A good reputation system would be sufficiently decentralized to minimize the impact of the biases (which are bound to exist, as well as grow over time) of a single authority.

Implementing such a reputation system is a massive undertaking in and of itself. Fortunately, we'll only need a small subset of features to be able to successfully launch the Network, while leaving the design and implementation of a full-fledged reputation system for later - when the Network is more mature.

At launch, I propose the following system: any user in the Network can flag fraudulent activity, and a centralized reputation authority would assess the claim. If it sees merit in it, the authority would ban the bad actor from the Network.

### Synchronization

A key functionality of personal tokens is capital gains distribution to personal token shareholders when the personal token owner sells their equity in other personal tokens / companies - proportional to how much equity the shareholder holds.

This distribution of capital gains happens immediately when the equity sold is in a personal token because the capital gains happens within the Network itself, therefore the distribution can happen automatically (programmatically - whenever equity in a personal token is sold - the capital to be distributed to shareholders goes directly into their wallets, it never even reaches the personal token owner).

But, we need a way to know when equity in companies is sold by a personal token owner who has shareholders because this transaction happens out of the Network.

<SyncScene />

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as Angellist, etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

In the long-run, the Network should aim to be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies as well in order to eliminate relying on self-reporting by individuals. I have no good ideas how to approach this in the short-term, but I predict that there will be some ways to make this happen as the Network matures and reaches a critical mass in number of users and market capitalization.

### Discovery

Over time the Network should facilitate match-making between investors and individuals they'd want to invest in.

### Culture

Adding culture as a necessary function to support the Network might feel weird because it seems more like an emergent property of the Network rather than something we can directly control. Yet, the culture of a network is perhaps its most important feature: a culture influences what its members want, and what its members want determines how a network will evolve.

By culture I mean a shared set of beliefs, values and priorities. In order to democratize opportunity, we need to maximize growth. To maximize growth, we need a culture of ambition. Ambition simultaneously maximizes growth (as members aim bigger) and minimizes fraud because ambitious individuals wouldn't want to tarnish their reputation for a puny reward compared to what they would achieve by fulfilling their ambitions.

It's tempting to promote ambition in a hard-handed way - e.g. by only admitting individuals into the Network who we consider to be ambitious enough, by setting a minimum investment amount, etc. - because it is impossible to set a criteria to accurately identify ambition. The most ambitious individuals are precisely the ones who operate beyond any rigid, predetermined criteria. Therefore, the Network needs to give space to the market to identify ambition, without imposing any specific notion of ambition as a filter - which will certainly be too rigid and inaccurate).

The Network will have to be open to all, regardless of the domains they operate in, whether they are artists, technologists, entrepreneurs, or creators of any kind.

We can only cultivate ambition in an off-handed, indirect way: by celebrating achievements by personal token holders, and to make such successes visible to all on the Network - to inspire everyone to think bigger and aim higher.

The right incentives (which we have through personal tokens), and sufficient visibility of success on the Network should be enough to encourage more ambition over time.

## V. Governance

### Sufficient decentralization

By decentralization, I mean decentralization of power: distributing power to many, as opposed to concentrating power in the hands of few. <Annotation>Unfortunately because of the hype surrounding crypto, many assume decentralization to just mean slapping everything onto a blockchain. Decentralization is a civilizational theme that is much broader than any specific piece of technology, and has been a growing trend for centuries.</Annotation>

Naturally, there's a notion of "degree": the more decentralized a network of people is, the more individuals the power is distributed to, and the more evenly it's distributed.

Examples of decentralization of varying degrees:

- Dictatorship < representative democracy < individual democracy (every decision voted on by everyone).
- Social platform with one feed algorithm < Social platform with a marketplace of third party feed algorithms < social platform in which each user can create their own algorithm by training their own AI model.
- One centralized bank that controls all transactions < multiple competing banks < peer to peer transactions without an intermediary.

Before we explore the pros and cons of decentralization and why it makes sense to build the Network in a decentralized way, it would help to understand what decentralization looks like in the context of the Network of personal tokens so that we can ground our discussion in the practical impact on our Network, rather than have it be a philosophical discussion.

#### Decentralization in the context of the Network:

**1. Decentralized representation of personal tokens**: at the core of the Network is information about personal tokens: who owns how much of which token. Transacting equity in personal tokens is essentially just manipulating this ledger. By making this ledger decentralized, there is no centralized source of truth that can be easily manipulated by a third party.

**2. Decentralized admissions**: instead of a centralized authority determining who can get into the Network and benefit from it, that power is decentralized in the hands of the many investors: if you can successfully raise capital by selling equity in your personal token, you are officially an active participant in the Network. There isn't a singular notion / criteria for what makes someone investable, but rather many competing notions.

**3. Decentralized reputation system**. As discussed earlier, a reputation system must:

1. Uncover gaps between claims & reality.
2. Rubric to determine the degree of severity of a fraudulent action.
3. Consistently interpret & apply that rubric for specific cases.

A decentralized reputation system would have a distributed means to uncover lies (e.g. like a community notes system), multiple rubrics to select from, and multiple ways to interpret rubrics. Users can propose their own reputation systems and publish on an open market. As soon as a user "activates" a reputation system, it scores everyone in the Network according to its specific design. The reputation system that most people select over time will become the most popular and "de-facto" reputation system. And if users decide another one is better, they can switch to it.

**4. Decentralized discovery**: instead of a single algorithm (/ model) to match investors and individuals to invest in, anyone can create and publish their own algorithm that others can use.

#### Why decentralize?

A decentralized network is easier for users to trust, and enables the network to better evolve to match the growing needs of its users in ways that the builders of the network can't even imagine. I predict that with sufficient time, no system: whether nation, social platform, financial system, etc. will last unless it becomes sufficiently decentralized: distributing power among its users, and protecting that distribution through technology, without requiring users to have to rely on a fallible authority to preserve their individual rights and power.

Therefore, in order for the Network to stand the test of time and last for centuries, it must be designed to be sufficiently decentralized at its core, and evolve to be more decentralized over time. As discussed earlier, opportunity will not be democratized overnight. It will take time. The Network must last.

A decentralized representation of ownership in personal tokens builds trust: it's not easy for someone (say an individual, or company, or even government) to manipulate your ownership in personal tokens without your permission.

Decentralization encourages people to build on top of the Network because they don't feel like they're building on someone else's land that can be snatched away from them anytime.

For example, an application built on the Network could allow users to form "collectives" which invest in personal tokens together. Future educational institutions, and mentorship programs could be created as collectives on the network with the teachers, and perhaps even alumni, investing together in every new student they accept.

Similarly, there are many potential, useful, applications that can be built on a decentralized personal token network that we can't even imagine right now - in the same way that the early creators of the internet couldn't imagine the rich possibilities that could be created on top of the internet (social platforms, tools, knowledge bases, remote collaboration, etc.) Therefore, building a network in a decentralized way is also a form of healthy humility: accepting that our imaginations are limited and that we need the help of users and third party creators to build on top of the network in order for the network to best serve its users.

#### Optimal decentralization

Decentralization has a cost:

1. Less efficient in the early days. A centralized authority can make decisions more swiftly.
2. Can be less secure: when a transaction is irreversible by a centralized authority, individuals must be more careful because you can't simply reverse the transaction / easily recover stolen assets like how you can do with the [chargeback system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp) with traditional financial transactions.
3. Takes more time to design, build, and iterate on such that it's simple to use, secure, while still being sufficiently decentralized.

What is the optimal amount of decentralization, and which factors determine optimality?

Decentralize too quickly and you end up with a system that makes it more difficult to get traction and grow. Decentralize too slow and you will be outcompeted by a more decentralized network. It's a balancing act.

I propose that in the early days of the Network, the ledger that keeps track of ownerships in personal tokens is decentralized (maintained on a blockchain), while the reputation system that tackles fraud be centralized in the hands of the core team. Building a decentralized reputation system requires a sufficient number of users and transactions on the Network which we will not have in the beginning.

This will allow us to ship the Network quickly, gain initial traction and then start to decentralize the Network more as the Network becomes more mature.

### Network token

In order to build a Network that lasts, its users need to be incentivized to preserve and evolve it. In other words, **users need a stake in the overall Network itself**.

I propose a "Network token" to enable people to hold a stake in the entire Network itself.

The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It is not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. Its shares can be traded freely without requiring anyone's approval.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold on the network through a fundraising event, a small equity stake (0.1%) in each personal token is automatically granted to the Network Token as a "transaction fee". The more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.

Therefore, the Network token's portfolio represents the Network itself.

The Network Token is divided into 10 million shares that can be freely traded, allowing anyone to invest in the overall growth and success of the Network.

As with with personal tokens, whenever a user sells their equity in any personal token, say Amy sells her equity in Jane's personal token, a percentage of the capital gains falls into the wallet of the Network token proportional to how much equity the Network token holds in Amy's personal token.

<NetworkTokenScene />

The wallet associated with the Network token will be treated the Network's treasury. To balance operational needs with shareholder returns, when new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained in the treasury to be used for legal compliance, development of new features, security, and anything that's is required to preserve the integrity of the Network.

### Core team

The core team will be responsible for designing, implementing and iterating on the Network. This will include people from a variety of backgrounds: design, engineering, legal.

The wallet associated with the Network token will act as the treasury for this team who can use the money in the wallet towards building the Network.

This team will remain as small as possible. In the early days, in order to make execution efficient, this core team will have authority on how it prioritizes its work. Over time, power will be more decentralized - enabling every user to have a say in key decisions about how the Network functions, which features to prioritize, and in general, how the capital in the treasury is allocated.

### Promoting competition

The greatest cause for the failure of a group is complacency. We are our worst enemies.

Complacency is a natural reaction to success. In order for the Network to last, it's not enough to have the right design & implementation. The most important factor is having a culture that never becomes complacent.

Unfortunately, I suspect this is a near impossible task because mental balance is elusive: the mind is either paranoid or complacent, and seldom at the optimal. Anyone who has done anything nontrivial understands this truth experientially.

Therefore, in order to build a Network that lasts, we must consistently strive to reduce the barrier to compete with us. Constant competitive pressure is a healthy mental stabilizer that prevents complacency. It's far easier to manage the paranoia that we will be outcompeted, than it is to manage the complacency that comes with success.

What would this look like?

1. Open source code. Anyone should be able to "fork" the network and spin up their own version of it quickly.
2. Make it easy for users of the Network to move to a competing network, or even operate in multiple networks simultaneously if they want to.
3. A culture of publishing our discoveries to the world as soon as we have them - especially if we believe it will help competition.

## VI. Implementation

This chapter focuses on implementing the Network _at launch_, and not how it ought to be implemented later on as the Network matures. In other words, this is the implementation of the "MVP": minimum viable product.

### Network at launch

**1. Core functionality**: everything in the "How it works" chapter above - the ability to join the Network by creating a personal token, raise capital through discrete fundraising rounds, invest in personal tokens, and sell your equity in a personal token to others.

**2. Selective admission**: the core team will vet the initial set of users to ensure that they're "high quality" individuals who are ambitious and operate on long time horizons. Early users will have an outsized impact on how the Network evolves, so it's important to get the right people on board: people who are also invested in the system of investing through personal tokens, in addition to wanting to invest in individuals.

**3. Centralized power to tackle fraud**: the core team will have the authority to ban users who try to lie / manipulate for profit. Users can complain to the core team about anything they're suspicious about, and the team will evaluate and take action. In the early days, even a small suspicion will be enough to blanket ban users because we won't have the resources to deal with each situation in a nuanced way. Since there will be a lot of capital changing hands for each fundraise, it's better to be safe than sorry.

That being said, each decision to ban a user will be transparent: it will be recorded on the personal token itself (on the public ledger) with an explanation +/ evidence for why the user was banned.

As mentioned above, as the Network matures, this reputation system must become more decentralized and nuanced such that users are impacted according to the severity of their actions. As decentralization happens, users that might have been banned earlier, will have more ways to challenge their bans and rejoin the Network.

**4. A web application** for users to access the Network and its functionality.

**5. High touch onboarding and support**. Raising capital through personal tokens / investing in personal tokens will be a new behavior for most users, therefore, it's important that we spend more time than we think we should to ensure that everything makes sense to users, and be quick to personally jump in and help resolve any issues they may have. This personal, human, high touch approach early on is critical to build trust in the Network. Until the Network achieves critical mass, users transacting in the Network are not only betting on each other, but also on the technology of personal tokens, as well as the team building the Network. We ought to be grateful for their bet on us, and express our gratefulness through our service.

### Technical

Network will be implemented on: [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/) (best developer experience, fastest growing ecosystem & the org behind it - Coinbase - is solid).

Transactions will use [USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) to eliminate unnecessary variables in personal token valuations, minimize volatility.

### Legal

A personal token is a new kind of financial instrument, and therefore, a large part of its implementation is in the legal instrument that represents a personal token and supports its functionality.

I'm working with lawyers to draft a clear legal implementation plan and will share details when the time is right. We will approach regulations head on by treating personal tokens as securities and working to remain compliant with all laws and regulations surrounding securities such as filing a Form D for each fundraise, etc.

In addition to the legal implementation, we'll need to make compliance simple for users of the Network, through education, standardized templates and filing on behalf of users wherever possible.

## VII. Notes

### Privacy

I predict that as personal tokens become popular, people will not mind their personal token valuations and transaction histories to be public information.

But, in the early days, users should have control over how much information about their personal tokens, fundraising history, valuations, transactions are public (or at least, how much of it can be associated with their real world identity). Insufficient privacy can even be a security issue. That being said, potential investors should have access to previous fundraising round information before they make their decision to invest or not.

We'll need to design a system that takes these nuances into account.
