### Trust

The Network ought to be implemented in a way that maximizes users' trust in the Network. Cultivating trust is the highest priority, because without trust, users won't invest, and without investments there is no Network. <Annotation>Trust is especially important in the early days because investing in personal tokens is a new behavior for the world: many will be skeptical.</Annotation>

A trustable Network is:
1. **Reliable**. The Network does as it says. It consistently, correctly updates its state on each transaction (buying / selling equity in personal tokens).
2. **Predictable**. Users should have confidence that the Network will continue to operate the way it does for the foreseeable future, based on the incentives that govern all of its members who act out of their self-interest, rather than based on the whims of a single user / authority.
3. **Honest**. Facts provided by the system are true (aligned with reality). Users can rely on information about who a user says they are, what they say they've accomplished, their previous fundraising rounds, etc.

In order to be trustable, the Network must be sufficiently decentralized.

### Sufficiently decentralized

Decentralization - *distributing power to many, as opposed to concentrating it in the hands of few* - creates trust. <Annotation>Unfortunately due of the hype surrounding crypto, many assume decentralization to just mean slapping everything onto a blockchain. Decentralization is a civilizational theme that is much broader than any specific piece of technology, and has been a growing trend for centuries.</Annotation>

Examples of decentralization (lesser to greater):
- Dictatorship < representative democracy < individual democracy (every decision voted on by everyone).
- Social platform with one feed algorithm < Social platform with a marketplace of third party feed algorithms < social platform in which each user can create their own content algorithm by training their own AI model.
- One bank that controls all transactions < multiple competing banks < peer to peer transactions without an intermediary.

In the context of the Network, decentralization can manifest in many ways. 

Let's start with its core: I propose implementing the personal token ledger (that keeps track of who owns how much of which personal tokens) on [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) + [Base](https://www.base.org/), using a stablecoin ([USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc)) as the currency that fuels transactions in the Network.

By decentralizing the ledger itself, and processing transactions through [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), the Network is more reliable and predictable. An authority, including the builders of the Network, can't easily manipulate personal token ownership, and the exchange of capital for shares in a personal token happens programmatically, eliminating the opportunity for delays and other messy situations.<Annotation>such as an investor receiving shares, and then realizing they can't pay for them, etc.</Annotation>

Another benefit of decentralizing the personal token ledger is that it enables the Network to evolve more rapidly to match the growing needs of its users in ways that the builders of the Network can't even imagine. Third party tools and applications can't be censored or blocked by an authority, encouraging users to build tools and experiences for themselves without the fear that what they build will be blocked in the future due to the [whims of a centralized authority](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price).

For example, a third party application built on the Network could allow users to form "collectives" which allows them to invest in personal tokens together. Future educational institutions, and mentorship programs could be created as collectives on the network with the teachers, and perhaps even alumni, investing together in every new student they accept. Another powerful application built on the Network would be discovery: connect individuals looking to raise capital, and investors, perhaps with a social feed angle.

Similarly, there are many potential, useful, applications that can be built on a decentralized personal token network that we can't even imagine right now - in the same way that the early creators of the internet couldn't imagine the rich possibilities that could be created on top of it (social platforms, tools, knowledge bases, remote collaboration, etc.) Decentralizing the foundation of the Network is also an expression of humility: we are accepting that our imaginations are limited and that we need the help of many creators to build experiences on top of personal tokens to meet the growing / changing needs of the users of the Network.

The personal token ledger is one of many functions the Network provides. Each function of the Network has the potential to be more decentralized. For example, a decentralized reputation system that identifies when a user is lying about their accomplishments through a [community  notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) type design would be far better than a central authority responsible for figuring out if a user is being dishonest.

Yet, decentralization has a cost:
1. Less efficient in the early days (before it achieves a critical mass of users and transactions). A centralized authority can make decisions more swiftly.
2. Can be less secure: when a transaction is irreversible by a centralized authority, it's far more tricky to recover stolen assets like how you can do with the [chargeback system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeback.asp) in traditional, centralized, financial systems.
3. Takes more time to design, build, and iterate on.

Decentralize too quickly and you end up with a system that makes it more difficult to get traction and grow. Decentralize too slow and you will be outcompeted by a more decentralized network that is easier to trust and more swiftly adapts to users' needs by better encouraging an ecosystem of third party applications.

At launch, I believe the right balance of decentralization is as follows: except for the core ledger, all other functions will be centralized: handled by the team responsible for building and maintaining the Network. As the Network gains momentum: adds users, increases transactions, all functions will become more decentralized. As I describe the remaining functions of the Network in the rest of this chapter, I'll describe what I think they should look like at launch, as well as a high level overview of how I see the function becoming more decentralized over time.

### Reputation

Users in the Network must trust that the information they obtain on the Network that they use to make investment decisions is truthful.

Fraudulent users will want to lie in order to raise capital by saying they are someone they're not or by exaggerating / outright lying about their past accomplishments.

The best way to minimize fraud is to:
1. Ensure users of the Network are highly ambitious. Ambitious individuals operate on longer time horizons and care more about their reputation. In a high trust network, people care about their reputations.
2. Effectively tarnish the reputation of bad actors. To do this, we'll need some kind of reputation system.

#### At launch:
The core team will have the authority to ban users who try to lie / manipulate for profit. Users can complain to the core team about anything they're suspicious about, and the team will evaluate and take action. 

In the early days, even a small suspicion will be enough to ban users because we won't have the resources to deal with each situation in a nuanced way. It's better to be safe than sorry.

That being said, each decision to ban a user will be transparent: it will be recorded on the personal token itself (on the decentralized personal token ledger) with an explanation (ideally with evidence) for why the user was banned.

#### Decentralized future implementation:
- would have a sufficiently granular "score" so that different kinds of fraud would impact reputation according to how badly they impact the Network.
- quickly uncovers gaps between what a user claims is true and reality through a [community notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Notes) design, but also with a way to financially reward contributors based on their performance.
- would have a rubric that correctly penalizes a misrepresentation proportional to how damaging it is to the health of the Network.
- would interpret the rubric accurately & consistently for each case.
- would make a user's reputation available publicly to let users to make more informed decisions about who they choose to invest in, or accept as investors.
- would have a fair way to challenge decisions that impacted a user's reputation score.
- would allow for multiple competing reputation systems. users can adopt the one that they they are most aligned with, or even create their own. To get to this point, AI will likely need to become more powerful (and cheaper) so that a user can write their own rubric, and the AI will score all other users of the Network with this rubric applied on ground truth determined by the community notes style function.

### Admission

Having highly ambitious users is critical for the success of the Network.

Ambitious ideas usually require sustained effort over long periods of time, and are usually highly collaborative in nature (not just in terms of needing a team to create, but also in terms of needing to raise capital from the world, and getting buy in from society at large).

**Ambitious individuals are forced to have high integrity** (proportional to how ambitious they are) because if they want to succeed they have to have a strong reputation in order to attract great teammates, raise capital, and importantly sustain both for long periods of time. Someone known for cheating their investors or teammates won't get far.

A Network of highly ambitious individuals with a strong reputation system as described above, will naturally have little fraud, and will grow quickly.

Therefore, it's tempting to restrict the Network only to ambitious individuals, but this would be a massive blunder because it is impossible to have a singular, accurate definition of what ambition looks like. Highly ambitious ideas (and therefore highly ambitious individuals) fall outside of definitions. In fact, it's that nature of being too weird to grasp that makes them so ambitious in the first place.

A network that has an "admission criteria" will become stale very quickly. It might work in the early days, but over time **any admission criteria will deteriorate towards rejecting the most ambitious individuals.**

The best way to approximate the definition of "highly ambitious" is to leave it to a free market of investors who each vote with their capital on the people who they think are highly ambitious. The Network's job is to rely on the signal provided by investors by giving privileges to those that have raised capital - such as being able to vote on feature / policy decisions, etc.

That being said, in the very early days, before the Network has a sufficient number of investors, it makes sense to have an admission criteria to try and admit only highly ambitious individuals, because there won't enough investors (i.e. enough votes) to accurately approximate the definition of "highly ambitious". As soon as we hit a sufficient number of investors, we will swiftly remove any admission criteria. 

With this in mind, I propose the following implementation:

#### At launch:

The core team will vet the initial set of users to ensure that they're ambitious individuals with strong potential. Early users will have an outsized impact on how the Network evolves, so it's important to get the right people on board: people who are also invested in the system of investing through personal tokens, in addition to wanting to invest in individuals.

#### Decentralized future implementation:

The Network will be completely unbiased: anyone can join the Network. But, only users who have been invested in, or have invested in others (above a minimum amount) will be treated as "active" users of the Network who will have certain privileges that others won't such as being able to vote on feature / policy decisions, etc.

### Synchronization

When personal token owners sell their equity in other personal tokens or companies, they share the capital gained with their own token shareholders (proportional to how much equity each shareholder holds).

When capital is gained by selling equity in a personal token, the Network can automatically distribute the capital gained to shareholders because the source of truth for personal tokens is within the Network. But, when a personal token owner sells equity in a company, how will that capital gained be distributed to shareholders?

<SyncScene />

In the early days of the Network, users will have to self-report capital gains from selling equity in companies.

If a user is early in their career and may want to raise more capital in the future (by selling more equity in their personal token), they are incentivized to accurately report capital gains out of the Network because it strengthens their pitch for their future fundraising round: in addition to showing how their valuation increased, they can also point to how much money they earned their shareholders since their last round of fundraising.

Yet, users who don't plan to raise capital in the future have an incentive to conveniently forget reporting off Network capital gains to avoid having to pay some of it to their shareholders.

Today, it doesn't look like there's no direct way for the Network to access this information (individuals and their equities in companies) because it's not public information. But, there still may be some ways to do so, such as: requiring users who have shareholders in their personal tokens to submit their annual tax returns - specifically the Schedule D / form 8948 which has information about how much equity was sold from which companies, for how much. Or perhaps connecting with the platforms that hold this information (such as [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/), etc.).

But, these approaches aren't "clean" so to speak: they still rely on individuals reporting information, which is difficult to rely on.

In the long-run, the Network should aim to be the de-facto source of truth for equity in companies as well in order to eliminate relying on self-reporting by individuals. We may likely need to work closely with the government to do this.

### Access

#### At launch:
A web app to access the Network and its functionality.

#### Decentralized future implementation:
Anyone can create and publish their client to access the Network.

### Support

Raising capital through personal tokens / investing in personal tokens will be a new behavior for most users, therefore, it's important that we spend more time than we think we should to ensure that everything makes sense to users, and be quick to personally jump in and help resolve any issues they may have. This personal, human, high touch approach early on is critical to build trust in the Network. 

Until the Network achieves critical mass, users transacting in the Network are not only betting on each other, but also on the technology of personal tokens, as well as the team building the Network. We ought to be grateful for their bet on us, and express our gratefulness through our unparalleled service.
